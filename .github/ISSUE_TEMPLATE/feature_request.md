AFTER SAVING YOUR TICKET

    1. Add any labels that you think fit your ticket e.g. enhancement, bug, high priority e.t.c. Some of these will be added by default.
    2. Add your ticket to a GitHub project (I suggest the Dev Sprint). Without this, your ticket won't appear in our immediate planning and may get lost in the repo.
    3. If already discussed, assign the ticket to the responsible person. Otherwise, assign it to Edwin or Kate.
