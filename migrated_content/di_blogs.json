There is no question that the last three years have been a time of political upheaval in the UK, and turbulence will continue for the foreseeable future with Brexit likely to dominate the agenda. But the business of government must continue. As a new government takes office, with some potentially significant changes in approach and ideology, it is important to reflect on what their other priorities should be. The UK has an important role it can and should play, both in remembering the promises made in the Sustainable Development Goals (promises the UK was key in shaping) and in continuing to shape the future of global development efforts as we move closer to the \u2018decade of delivery\u2019 for Agenda 2030.</p>\n<p>We have promised to deliver sustainable development for all, to leave no one behind, and to ensure everyone benefits from growth; however, as\u00a0DI\u2019s recent briefing shows, globally the <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/closing-gap-priorities-high-level-political-forum-2019/\" target=\"_blank\">poorest people continue to be left behind</a> in terms of income, progress and opportunity. In some cases that gap is actually growing: the gap between the daily income of the poorest 20% globally and everyone else, for example, is projected to grow from $13.71 in 2000 to $22.73 by 2030. This concerning trend is also borne out by non-income indicators of poverty and marginalisation, such as education completion or childhood mortality. Globally the progress of the poorest 20% of people is not accelerating fast enough (or at all, in many cases) to catch up with the rest. This is particularly true for certain groups and demographics, such as gender \u2013 girls have a lower rate of successfully completing secondary education than boys, for instance. Alongside this, the resources needed to address these challenges \u2013 financing both from domestic governments and international flows such as aid \u2013 are not prioritising the poorest people and places. Bilateral aid to the least developed countries, for example, has grown by only 0.1% since 2010, while other bilateral aid has grown by 15%.</p>\n<p>Alok Sharma takes office as Secretary of State only months away from critical moments \u2013 such as September\u2019s SDG Summit in New York \u2013 that could be key to driving global efforts around delivering on the SDGs. The new Secretary of State and the UK need to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Continue championing the promises made on aid (to reach 0.7% of GNI) and improving targeting of aid to the poorest places and people. Sharma has already recognised in his <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/alok-sharma-has-been-appointed-secretary-of-state-for-international-development\" target=\"_blank\">appointment statement</a> that delivering on the 0.7% commitment \u201cshows we are an enterprising, outward-looking and truly global Britain that is fully engaged with the world\u201d, and emphasised the importance of facilitating access to education for the poorest and most vulnerable people. Delivering on commitments also means driving investment to vital human capital sectors including education but also health and social protection.</li>\n<li>Move the promise to Leave No One Behind back up the agenda. The UK was one of the lead architects of the commitment, and championed critical parts of it \u2013 in particular on gender and disability. Leaving no one behind is key to closing the gap and delivering the core of the SDG promise, and the UK must retake that mantle and help drive real action to meet the spirit of that promise.</li>\n<li>Build on the UK\u2019s strong historic record of championing and driving progress in transparency, evidence and data use to drive better decision making. Promoting a strong agenda on data on people to ensure everyone is counted and counts \u2013 particularly people who are being left behind and marginalised \u2013 would be a critical step.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The UK has a chance to show the world it is serious about remaining a \u2018Global Britain\u2019 and, in Sharma\u2019s own words, to transform the lives of the world\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable people. But doing so requires action, and a willingness to stand up on the global stage and champion this agenda.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/dfid/48367784362\" target=\"_blank\">Photo credit:\u00a0Benet Coulber/DFID</a></p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "From review to delivery on the Global Goals \u2013 wh...", "author": ["Harpinder Collacott"], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "18 Jul 2019", "description": "On 26 June, the UK government published its Voluntary National Review measuring delivery against the Global Goals - but does it accurately capture progress?", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/review-delivery-global-goals-immediate-priorities-uk-government/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>On 26 June, the UK government published its <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/uk-voluntary-national-review-of-progress-towards-the-sustainable-development-goals\" target=\"_blank\">Voluntary National Review</a> (VNR) of the UK\u2019s progress against the Global Goals. The review was led by the UK\u2019s Department for International Development (DFID), and the UK\u2019s International Development Committee (IDC) has responded with heavy criticism in a <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmintdev/1732/173202.htm\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> published this week. The IDC has accused the government of \u2018casting doubt\u2019 on its commitment to the SDGs due to <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/international-development-committee/news-parliament-2017/sustainable-development-goals-report-publication-17-19/\" target=\"_blank\">\u2018serious failings\u2019</a> in its first VNR. Brexit and uncertainty about the Conservative Party leadership have created an uncertain and unstable backdrop that no doubt will have had an impact on how well the process of developing the VNR was executed. Nonetheless, the Committee\u2019s report raises some valid concerns.</p>\n<p>First is that the process was rushed, despite the fact that this is the UK\u2019s only review since the Global Goals were ratified in 2015. As a result, consultation and discussions with a range of stakeholders \u2013 a vital part of measuring progress towards the SDGs \u2013 were performed at the last minute, and often had unclear outcomes. The concern in the Committee\u2019s report that data and \u2018vignettes\u2019 were \u2018cherry picked\u2019 places into question whether the VNR paints a true picture of the UK\u2019s progress on the Global Goals. If the VNR does not accurately portray progress, how can we know whether the UK equipped with the right evidence to deliver a transformative agenda for the \u2018decade of action\u2019 \u2013 the ten years remaining to hit the high ambitions set out for 2030? It seems the UK VNR has fallen short of expectations, and these criticisms should serve as a warning that something needs to be done.</p>\n<p>At home, progress on the goals has been slow to mobilise and patchy, with the full integration of this transformative agenda across government still not realised. Unfortunately for the UK, DFID\u2019s leadership on the VNR demonstrates that the goals remain within the purview of DFID, and siloed within the international development agenda.</p>\n<p>Abroad, we know we are <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/closing-gap-priorities-high-level-political-forum-2019/\" target=\"_blank\">off track to meet the SDGs globally</a> \u2013 particularly for those people furthest behind \u2013 and <a href=\"http://data.parliament.uk/WrittenEvidence/CommitteeEvidence.svc/EvidenceDocument/International%20Development/UK%20progress%20on%20the%20Sustainable%20Development%20Goals%20(SDGs)/Written/95968.html\" target=\"_blank\">our evidence</a> to the International Development Committee shows where there is room for improvement in the targeting of UK aid to the poorest. This is an area in need of attention, with a substantial and often growing gap between the poorest people and everyone else. Income inequality has grown in the last 15 years, with the very poorest making no progress at all. Secondary education completion rates also show a growing gap between the poorest 20% and the rest, and this is particularly acute for women. The poorest people are often not even counted \u2013 with the poorest 20% of children much less likely to be registered at birth.</p>\n<p>However, there are reasons to be hopeful that the UK can rise to these challenges. Despite the VNR leaving room for improvement, the UK\u2019s commitment to the SDGs through its international development agenda led by DFID is clear. <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/final-oda-data-2018-message/\" target=\"_blank\">It remains one of the largest aid donors in the world</a>, and one of very few who are committing to and delivering 0.7% of GNI. When we look at key policy priorities such as nutrition, <a href=\"https://nutritionforgrowth.org/nutrition-growth/\" target=\"_blank\">the UK is a leading global force</a> and according to the latest data <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/dfids-aid-spending-nutrition-2017/\" target=\"_blank\">is exceeding ambitious spending targets</a> in this area. Further, the UK has reported on 74% of the 244 SDG indicators \u2013 a higher number than most other countries\u2019 VNRs cover.</p>\n<p>As the UN High Level Political Forum comes to a close this week, member states should be coming away energised. With a decade to go, the Global Goals should be well embedded in the fabric of all countries, their domestic agendas and, where relevant, in their international development priorities. We are now turning our attention to the decade of action to ensure the world is on track to achieve the Global Goals at home and abroad.</p>\n<p><strong>So where should the UK be focusing its efforts as we move to the decade of action?</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>The\u00a0Cabinet Office should have fundamental responsibility for the UK\u2019s\u00a0Voluntary National Review\u00a0to promote a whole of government approach \u2013 coordinating efforts across government to meet the SDGs, whilst allowing DFID to continue its vital role. This will also build greater transparency and accountability for work on the SDGs in departments beyond DFID.</li>\n<li>The UK should continue to support efforts to improve data, evidence and understanding\u00a0about\u00a0the people most at risk of being left behind at home and abroad. This includes\u00a0investing in efforts to increase and improve the currently (very lacking) granularity, timeliness and accuracy of data.</li>\n<li>Increase funding to the countries and people who need it the most and are at risk of being left behind. This includes investing in core human capital priorities, and reversing the trend of declining official development assistance to sectors such as social protection, health and education.</li>\n<li>UK aid must focus on supporting countries to increase their statistical capacity. This should be done in a way that ensures people are being counted, and should include creating more complex measures of poverty to extend beyond income.</li>\n<li>Continue to champion 0.7% as a vital and internationally agreed target. If all OECD Development Assistance Committee donors had delivered on this target, there would be an additional <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/investments-to-end-poverty-2018/\" target=\"_blank\">US$1.5 trillion in development resources by 2030</a>, which would go a long way towards addressing the financing gap.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Three priorities for the High-level Political Foru...", "author": ["Carolyn Culey"], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "10 Jul 2019", "description": "DI Director of Partnerships & Engagement Carolyn Culey sets out three key priorities for closing the gap between the poorest and the rest at HLPF 2019", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/closing-the-gap-meeting-the-challenge-to-leave-no-one-behind/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"><p>The daily income gap between the poorest 20% of people and the rest of the population has been growing, both globally and in most countries.

Our latest briefing <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/closing-gap-priorities-high-level-political-forum-2019/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Closing the gap</em></a> sets out the current \u00a0challenges and highlights three key priorities to help close the growing gap between the poorest people and the rest, and to raise the incomes and living standards of those who are furthest behind. These priorities are: invest in comprehensive, sustainable and interoperable civil registration and administrative data systems; reverse the recent decline in overall official development assistance (ODA) spending and increase the proportion allocated to least developed countries (LDCs); and increase domestic and international spending on human capital priorities.</p>\n<p>The global picture of a growing income gap between the poorest 20% and the rest is repeated across most (87%) countries submitting <a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/hlpf/2019/\" target=\"_blank\">voluntary national reviews</a> at this year\u2019s forum. A similar pattern can be seen across VNR countries in all income groups \u2013 the gap is growing in all high-income countries, all but one upper-middle income country, over three-quarters of lower-middle income countries and all but one low income country.</p>\n<p>The briefing shows not only that progress has been slower for the poorest 20% of people, but also that those <em>within</em> the poorest 20% who are furthest behind, living at the lowest recorded level of poverty, have seen negligible progress over the past 15 years. Unless urgent action is taken to close the gap and raise the incomes of the poorest and most marginalised people, the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/development/desa/en/news/sustainable/leaving-no-one-behind.html\" target=\"_blank\">Agenda 2030 pledge to leave no one behind</a> risks becoming little more than empty rhetoric.</p>\n<p>But poverty is about much more than income. <em>Closing the gap</em> follows a range of gender-disaggregated indicators (the share of the population aged over 21 who have completed at least secondary education, under-five mortality, and the share of children aged under five who are stunted). These show that the poorest 20% start from a low baseline and experience slow progress. Compounding this inequality, the rate of progress of the poorest 20% is slower than the rest of the population on some indicators, so the gap is widening. On other indicators, the gap remains broadly the same.</p>\n<p>Closing these gaps between the poorest 20% and the rest requires a concerted effort to improve the targeting of both domestic and international resources towards the people and places that need them most. In the words of Agenda 2030, financing decisions need to start \u201creaching the furthest behind first\u201d. But here too, we see a widening gap for example in relation to the allocation of ODA, where the data shows that gross ODA to LDCs has increased at a third of the rate of other aid since 2010, and less than half the rate of aid received by other developing countries and regions. Aid to LDCs from bilateral donors is particularly stark: levels were just 0.1% higher in 2017 than 2010, compared with 15% growth in bilateral aid to other developing countries and regions. Meanwhile, against the SDG 17.2 target for developed countries to fully implement their ODA commitments, global net ODA fell for the second year in a row in 2018 and only five donors met the 0.7% GNI target.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/closing-gap-priorities-high-level-political-forum-2019/figure-3-limited-growth-in-oda-to-ldcs-is-widening-the-gap-between-aid-to-some-of-the-poorest-countries-and-other-aid/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-18807\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-18807\" height=\"772\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1544px) 100vw, 1544px\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Figure-3-Limited-growth-in-ODA-to-LDCs-is-widening-the-gap-between-aid-to-some-of-the-poorest-countries-and-other-aid.jpg\" srcset=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Figure-3-Limited-growth-in-ODA-to-LDCs-is-widening-the-gap-between-aid-to-some-of-the-poorest-countries-and-other-aid.jpg 1544w, http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Figure-3-Limited-growth-in-ODA-to-LDCs-is-widening-the-gap-between-aid-to-some-of-the-poorest-countries-and-other-aid-768x384.jpg 768w\" width=\"1544\"/></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/resource-documents/12663.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Recent analysis in a joint paper by ODI and DI</a> examined the extent to which financing at the subnational level to healthcare and education by governments and donors targets the poorest regions. Our new paper looks at highlights the results in four countries submitting their VNRs this year for which data is available (Burkina Faso, Ghana, Rwanda and Tanzania) and finds that spending does not, for the most part, respond to the distribution of poverty in the country.</p>\n<p>One of the central challenges in implementing the leave no one behind pledge is to identify the groups and individuals who are excluded from progress. The poorest and most marginalised are those most likely to remain invisible in official data and statistics. Children in the poorest 20% remain significantly less likely to be registered at birth and in 2015, nearly half of those aged under five in this group did not have their births registered. Governments cannot begin to ensure that everyone is included in progress if they do not know they exist in the first place. All countries face data gaps in their SDG reporting. The UK, one of the wealthiest countries submitting a VNR this year, was able to report against 74% of 244 SDG indicators which puts the challenge faced by the poorest countries in perspective.</p>\n<p>To get SDGs 1 and 10 back on track, <em>Closing the gap</em> makes three key recommendations to actors at this year\u2019s High-level Political Forum:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Invest in comprehensive, sustainable and interoperable civil registration and administrative data systems.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Reverse the recent decline in overall ODA spending and increase the proportion allocated to LDCs.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Increase domestic and international spending on human capital priorities that most benefit the poorest people such as social protection, education, health and water and sanitation, and ensure this spending is targeted towards the people and places that need it most.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>For full analysis, read our briefing <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/closing-gap-priorities-high-level-political-forum-2019/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Closing the gap: priorities for the High-level Political Forum 2019</em></a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Three steps towards an equitable tax agenda: Actio...", "author": ["Gregory de Paepe"], "format": "Data blog", "date": "02 Jul 2019", "description": "Gregory de Paepe outlines three steps towards an equitable tax agenda that should be adopted at the Addis Tax Initiative conference this week", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/three-steps-towards-an-equitable-tax-agenda-actions-that-should-be-adopted-at-the-addis-tax-initiative-conference-this-week/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>This week, the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.addistaxinitiative.net/event/atiitc-tax-and-development-conference-2019\" target=\"_blank\">Addis Tax Initiative (ATI) conference</a>\u00a0will see around 170 representatives from partner and donor countries, international and regional organisations and civil society gather in Berlin to review progress made on strengthening international support for tax systems.

Improve efforts to increase total official support for domestic revenue mobilisation</h3>\n<p>If we continue with business as usual, development partners risk falling short of meeting their commitment of doubling official development assistance (ODA) to domestic revenue mobilisation by 2020. In 2017, the latest year for which data is available, ODA from ATI members represented approximately 70% of the ATI benchmark.\u00a0However, adding the ODA from non-ATI members, total support to domestic revenue mobilisation was on par with this benchmark and represented an estimated US$321 million.</p>\n<h4><span class=\"normaltextrun\">Figure 1\u00a0\u2013 Total official support for strengthening tax systems</span></h4>\n<p><span class=\"normaltextrun\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-18752\" height=\"541\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1262px) 100vw, 1262px\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Figure-1_-Total-official-support-for-strengthening-tax-systems.png\" srcset=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Figure-1_-Total-official-support-for-strengthening-tax-systems.png 1262w, http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Figure-1_-Total-official-support-for-strengthening-tax-systems-768x329.png 768w\" width=\"1262\"/></span></p>\n<p><em>Source: ODA disbursements taken from Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Creditor Reporting System (CRS); ATI benchmark line as set out in the ATI monitoring report 2015; and private grants from foundations sourced from OECD CRS and the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) database.<br/>\n</em><em>Notes: Data includes all activities coded through the OECD DRM purpose code (15114) and wider projects which contain descriptive information indicating a major DRM component.

For\u00a0example,\u00a0in 2017 Luxemburg\u00a0and Sweden\u00a0already exceeded their 2020 targets, while others, such as Australia and Canada, were not far off achieving this.</p>\n<p>Since the launch of the ATI in 2015, several major development partners have overhauled their domestic revenue mobilisation strategies to fit the priorities of a constantly evolving tax and development agenda, <a href=\"https://www.addistaxinitiative.net/resource/ati-monitoring-brief-2016-ati-commitment-1\" target=\"_blank\">explaining some of the delays in uptake of ODA to domestic revenue mobilisation</a>.

Place more focus on critical \u2018tax reform enablers\u2019, particularly civil society organisations and non-governmental organisations</span></h3>\n<p>In 2017 non-governmental organisations (NGOs), both domestic and international, received only 8% of total ODA for domestic revenue mobilisation. While higher than the proportion in 2015 (3%), this remains low, especially compared to the more tested multilateral and bilateral partners.</p>\n<h4><span class=\"normaltextrun\">Figure 2 \u2013 Channels of delivery: a small proportion of ODA for domestic revenue mobilisation goes through NGOs</span></h4>\n<p><span class=\"normaltextrun\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-18755\" height=\"498\" sizes=\"(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Figure-2a_-Channels-of-delivery_2015.png\" srcset=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Figure-2a_-Channels-of-delivery_2015.png 788w, http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Figure-2a_-Channels-of-delivery_2015-768x485.png 768w\" width=\"788\"/><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-18751\" height=\"534\" sizes=\"(max-width: 791px) 100vw, 791px\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Figure-2b_-Channels-of-delivery_2017.png\" srcset=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Figure-2b_-Channels-of-delivery_2017.png 791w, http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Figure-2b_-Channels-of-delivery_2017-768x518.png 768w\" width=\"791\"/></span></p>\n<p><em>Source:\u00a0Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Creditor Reporting System (CRS) (ODA disbursements),<br/>\n</em><em>Notes:\u00a0US$ millions, constant 2015 prices.</em></p>\n<p>Leaving civil society organisations (CSOs) and NGOs at the margin of support to tax policy may undermine these programmes\u2019 effectiveness.

While CSOs are not the sole solution to address political economy challenges to tax reforms, strengthening their capacity on tax issues could foster broad-based, demand-driven domestic commitment to tax reform.\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/resource-documents/11753.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">An ODI review of six tax system reforms</a> argued that, \u201c<em>involving non-governmental actors (including businesses, civil society and the media) is essential for balancing tax reform negotiations in favour of the public interest: towards more productive, equitable and fairer tax systems.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Partnerships between tax administrations and civil society could also support a more equitable tax agenda. Trusted non-governmental bodies may reinforce the importance of paying taxes and explain controversial tax issues, increasing public confidence in the system through greater understanding. The recent success of the <a href=\"https://csbag.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Civil Society Budget Accountability Group (CSBAG)</a> campaigns, with their members in Uganda, to alter tax policy, on <a href=\"https://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1476786/civil-society-actors-critical-mobile-money-tax\" target=\"_blank\">mobile money</a> and on\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1499225/mps-increase-tax-sodas-energy-drinks\" target=\"_blank\">sugary drinks</a> is just one example demonstrating how CSOs can contribute to domestic revenue mobilisation in terms of both quantity and quality of tax reforms. Another example would be CSBAG\u2019s support to the government in its formulation of a\u00a0medium-term\u00a0revenue strategy.</p>\n<p>During the past decade, international NGOs have proven their capacity to move the needle on critical global tax challenges, such as tax evasion and tax avoidance. The next frontier is to identify and strengthen capable domestic CSOs/NGOs that can drive the policy discussion on domestic tax reforms towards more equitable fiscal policies that leave no one behind.</p>\n<h3>3. Increase core funding to enable effective civil society engagement with tax issues</h3>\n<p>The scale of support to domestic civil society compared to recipient governments is stark. It is no secret that <a href=\"https://www.transparency-initiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tai_taxanddevelopment_full_oct14.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">financial sustainability is a major impediment to increasing CSO/NGO work on tax issues</a>.</p>\n<p>One practical way of supporting constructive civil society engagement with tax issues would be to increase official, and direct, support to CSOs/NGOs that have a proven track record. Additionally, development partners should use more core funding to tackle these issues, instead of relying mostly on inflexible project aid \u2013 as encouraged by the Ugandan \u2018Advocates Coalition for Development and Environment\u2019 (ACODE). Core funding enables CSOs/NGOS to address contemporary tax issues arising in their country, instead of extending the scope of their work within a given resource envelope and priorities (most often set by the development partners).</p>\n<p>Development partners have different views and expectations from partnering with CSOs on tax issues. Finland\u2019s <a href=\"https://um.fi/documents/35732/48132/tax_and_development_finland%E2%80%99s_action_programme_2016%E2%80%932019.pdf/b720eebf-343b-aca6-e8b3-fc99b1f108bc?t=1560450206884\" target=\"_blank\">Tax and Development Action Programme</a>, for example, explicitly focuses on increasing civil society\u2019s awareness on the link between taxation and public service delivery. The UK takes a less direct approach, and partners with national civil society for analysis of the differential impact tax support may have on different vulnerable groups.</p>\n<p><strong>The ATI breakout session on \u2018<a href=\"https://www.taxcompact.net/sites/default/files/2019-06/AGENDA.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">CSOs and tax strengthening</a>\u2019 will provide a timely opportunity to consider how development partners can practically strengthen the capacity of domestic CSOs in support of more country-owned equitable tax systems.</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/usaidethiopia/13266784653/in/photolist-mdkJSr-6vDZ4K-6jY4hU-6jBWBN-6jxL82-6jK37J-6jJTtS-7vVngv-6jxLk8-6jTMAi-6jBc3q-7vUE6c-68ZFg6-6vE8sr-9GFHJr-6vEeAV-7vUScn-7vVzUF-6jY363-6jTBUt-6vDEy2-DvQPtj-4xHBKB-5TUnBq-s4XeJe-6y7wxz-6jXUBd-kZEBaK-DacH2L-TeakqK-22fMfJp-ZUn5LW-Y4k9qN-viyxg-7z3LrV-6y7wor-Zs9isH-7z7xnu-JFgB7H-JgvRJ4-EhCVXK-23k26Yc-2gkNci2-2gkNk5b-2gkNjKP-2gkNaDL-2gidCQF-2gidkpi-2ghJ8gB-2ghJ7ZQ\" target=\"_blank\">Photo: Kelley Lynch</a></p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "From withdrawal to adaptation: How can development...", "author": ["Sarah Dalrymple"], "format": "Data blog", "date": "27 Jun 2019", "description": "DI\u2019s Sarah Dalrymple highlights some key research questions towards building coherence across development, crisis and peace sectors", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/development-actors-shift-approach-sustain-engagement-financing-scale-crisis/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"><p><strong>DI\u2019s Sarah Dalrymple highlights some key research questions towards building coherence across development, crisis and peace sectors</strong></p>\n</div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>The role of development actors and financing mechanisms when a crisis occurs is both a critical aspect of the <a href=\"https://legalinstruments.oecd.org/public/doc/643/643.en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">humanitarian\u2013development\u2013peace nexus</a>\u00a0and a pressing gap in existing evidence. A point of consensus emerging from the discussion between panellists at our recent <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/emerging-trends-development-finance-mean-crisis-actors/\" target=\"_blank\">webinar</a> is that development responses must adapt and remain sustained when a crisis occurs. In line with the emerging rhetoric around the need for longer-term development approaches in protracted crisis contexts, development responses must continue to support livelihoods and service delivery at scale during a crisis, and work closely with humanitarian and peace actors based on the comparative advantages their mandates offer. Doing so (as opposed to shrinking engagement and handing over to humanitarian actors to lead the response) may prevent a crisis becoming protracted in the first place.</p>\n<p>Yet the figure below shows that between 2008 and 2017 there was an opposite trend in protracted crisis contexts. Over the first five years of a crisis, development actors (in aggregate) significantly downscaled their activities in crisis-affected countries. In the 27 protracted-crisis countries our analysis identified<a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\">[i]</a> aggregate developmental ODA fell sharply between the first and fourth years of crisis, before recovering slightly whilst remaining at a lower level. Although humanitarian assistance rose throughout the first five years of crisis, this rise was not enough to replace the fall in developmental ODA. By year four, developmental ODA was almost US$5 billion lower than in year one, but humanitarian assistance had increased by just US$2.6 billion. At the end of year five, developmental ODA had recovered slightly to almost US$4 billion below the year one level, while humanitarian aid rose to US$2.9 billion higher than in year one.</p>\n<h3>Rise in humanitarian aid does not cover fall in other ODA within first five years of crisis</h3>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-18710\" height=\"623\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1996px) 100vw, 1996px\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Rise-in-humanitarian-aid-does-not-cover-fall-in-other-ODA-within-first-five-years-of-crisis.jpg\" srcset=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Rise-in-humanitarian-aid-does-not-cover-fall-in-other-ODA-within-first-five-years-of-crisis.jpg 1996w, http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Rise-in-humanitarian-aid-does-not-cover-fall-in-other-ODA-within-first-five-years-of-crisis-768x240.jpg 768w\" width=\"1996\"/></p>\n<p>What aspects of how development responses are planned, delivered and financed in crisis contexts needs to shift to engender an approach of adaptation and sustained engagement?</p>\n<p>DI is commencing a strand of research focusing on this specific issue, incorporating country-level analysis. We\u2019ll be seeking country-level evidence; finding cases where development responses have been sustained at scale or reduced following the onset of crisis will help actors to identify both lessons on the challenges faced and options for overcoming these, and to recognise the best practise and successful approaches that could be transformative and scaled-up at the global level and adopted internationally.</p>\n<h3>The role of development actors once a crisis occurs:</h3>\n<h4>How do fluctuations in developmental and humanitarian ODA affect different sectors and regions?</h4>\n<p><strong>Where there has been a significant decline, continuation or rise in developmental ODA at the country level in the first five years of a crisis \u2013 does it rise or fall across the board </strong><strong>or does it affect specific sectors and geographical areas? And how does this align with the focus of humanitarian spending</strong><strong>?</strong> If we knew whether development aid focused on specific sectors and geographic areas and withdraw from others, or how well aligned it is with humanitarian spending at this time, we could identify where the biggest gaps are in terms of support to service delivery and livelihoods. We could also draw lessons regarding the role of development actors in supporting specific activities during a crisis, and on what worked well, what didn\u2019t, and why.</p>\n<p>Our initial data analysis has identified a selection of countries that demonstrate different trends \u2013 either a fall in developmental ODA in the first five years of a crisis (e.g. Afghanistan since 2011), or rise in developmental ODA after an initial stumble in the first two years (e.g. in Nigeria and Cameroon during 2015\u20132017). These could provide interesting evidence for research on this issue.</p>\n<h4>What factors drive decisions for different actors?<strong>\u00a0</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Where development programming reduced in the first five years of a crisis, what factors underpinned this decision? </strong>Challenges in continuing partnerships in an altered context could include: inflexibility of financing mechanisms and programmes to adapt to a changing context, limited access to contingency funds, security concerns and risks, and inflexible results frameworks. Answering this is key to understanding what changes are needed in development financing and programming frameworks to adapt to crisis contexts.</li>\n<li><strong>Where development programming was sustained during the first five years of a crisis, what factors underpinned this decision? </strong>Identifying the types of development programming and financing approaches, channels of assistance and partnerships that enabled development actors to sustain engagement during a crisis will provide lessons on successes and challenges, ways of working collaboratively with humanitarian actors, and help with assessing the potential for scaling these approaches up within countries, or expanding them to other countries.</li>\n<li><strong>Were decisions to downscale or sustain development programming driven locally/nationally, and made in a consultative way? </strong>A better understanding of decision-making responsibilities within development assistance will flag how these could adapt to crisis contexts and enable greater flexibility of response (in consultation with humanitarian and peace actors and led by local and national actors).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>What concrete approaches we should consider?</h4>\n<p><strong>What aspects of development programming and financing frameworks should shift to enable development actors to sustain engagement in crisis contexts at scale? </strong>This would involve assessing existing approaches and identifying new ones that support development actors to sustain engagement during a crisis. For example, these might be: how contextual assessments are undertaken; how development programmes are designed, delivered, financed and assessed; and options for strengthening complementarity with humanitarian and peacebuilding responses and financing approaches.</p>\n<p>Further approaches might include embedding adaptive programming, crisis modifiers and contingency financing within development responses; utilising existing relationships between development actors and partner governments to strengthen national capacities to respond to crisis; and ensuring that development actors have the right skills to adapt their approach during times of crisis.</p>\n<p>To provide feedback or information that could feed in to our research, please get in touch:\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:sarah.dalrymple@devinit.org\" target=\"_blank\">sarah.dalrymple@devinit.org</a></p>\n<p><strong>For further updates, resources and\u00a0discussion around this webinar series, which focuses on the humanitarian\u2013development\u2013peace nexus, follow\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=ditriplenexus\" target=\"_blank\">#DITripleNexus</a></strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldbank/32353992212/in/photolist-Ri1EFW-JLekDQ-dWQj8D-CZNvsn-6iTSaa-6iTSov-4GocEc-RkEM4X-23k26Yc-zubDC1-26etYtg-26aQ4af-JGoizk-Ld7BJT-FLFTea-Ld7xJP-M4hxr8-M7buLN-Ld7FjP-7wbvq9-TbmFHQ-234y7Jm-24SwPUK-C8hRgL-Fa5nVr-GFmciW-EXhgfX-24Pa2J4-zQ1jRg-mthwPq-msbJBw-MiPxyX-A1xe9Q-EXhTs6-Lk2Kwp-EX6FV1-KzZaKW-Lis5Wb-FSxjnx-KYq3GG-GgZZ6v-EX6HBh-KzZ1zw-FSxoJ8-EX6E3y-KzZkmu-KYq2ou-FsqHmb-MsnK7E-KzZ6GW\" target=\"_blank\">Photo: Mohammad Al-Arief/The World Bank</a></p>\n</div><div class=\"row--cards\" ng-if=\"post.notes\">\n<div class=\"col-md-12 card m-b--2\">\n<div class=\"card__content bg--light\">\n<h3 class=\"h3\">Notes</h3>\n<div> <p><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\">[i]</a>\u00a0These were selected on the basis of having had a Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) for any five consecutive years during 2008\u20132017.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"}, {"title": "How resource allocation for climate change and DRR...", "author": ["Henry Odhiambo"], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "19 Jun 2019", "description": "How investments to mitigate and prevent climate change and disasters might ensure sustainable development and reach the poorest and most vulnerable people", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/resource-allocation-climate-change-drr-county-governments-kenya-potential-support-progress-people-poverty/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>Following the publication of reports on how resource allocation for <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/tracking-subnational-government-investments-climate-change-mitigation-adaptation-kenya/\" target=\"_blank\">climate change</a> and <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/county-drr-budget-tracking-kenya/\" target=\"_blank\">DRR </a>by Kenya\u2019s county governments has the potential to support the progress of people out of poverty, Development Initiatives (DI) held an event in May 2019 in Kisumu, to consider whether the current budget allocations of four Kenyan counties is sufficient to meet the needs of the poorest people. Participants \u2013 including the county government officials in charge of climate change and DRR dockets, development partners, policy researchers, CSOs and media representatives \u2013 reiterated that Kenya\u2019s economy is highly dependent on climate-sensitive sectors such as agriculture, tourism, transport and energy. And that this intrinsic link, if not well managed, can pose a risk to the country\u2019s potential for economic development and prosperity.</p>\n<p>Reports by various key actors \u2013 including <a href=\"https://www.ndma.go.ke/index.php/resource-center/national-drought-bulletin/send/39-drought-updates/5188-national-drought-status-update-for-may-2019\" target=\"_blank\">National Drought Management Authority</a> \u2013 suggest that frequent cycles of prolonged droughts followed by severe flooding impact the livelihoods of many Kenyans, including the poorest people. Appropriate investments on climate change will build the resilience of communities and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Deliberate and targeted budget allocations to disaster risk reduction will enhance the capacity of communities to prepare, prevent, respond and recover from disasters. These investment have the potential to create a ripple effect in the country\u2019s economy: not only ensuring sustainable development but also reaching the poorest and most vulnerable people, who bear the brunt of both climate change and disasters.</p>\n<h4>Key discussion points from the event</h4>\n<p><em>The poor are likely to be left behind in the absence of adequate investment in DRR and climate change adaptation and mitigation actions.</em> County governments were urged, as the first point of contact with climate-affected populations, to play a role in managing climate change adaptation and mitigation, and DRR investment in Kenya. The participants observed that despite efforts by county governments, the problem is likely to be compounded by governance-related problems. In a number of the counties under discussion, for example, specific legislation and policy framework for climate change and disaster risk reduction were not in place.</p>\n<p><em>There is need to mobilise political will at the county executive and assembly levels to leverage county climate change funds (CCCF)</em>. These funds (which originate from Kenya\u2019s 2016 <a href=\"http://kenyalaw.org/lex/actview.xql?actid=No.%2011%20of%202016\" target=\"_blank\">Climate Change Act</a>) are a mechanism to prepare counties to access climate finance and mainstream climate in planning in support of adaptation for resilient economic development and poverty reduction. There is also need to fast-track establishment of the legal, policy and institutional frameworks prerequisite for effective functioning of a CCCF.</p>\n<p><em>Counties are facing obstacles in collecting accurate spending data, and clear budgetary and accounting procedures are not always in place.</em> Currently, most of Kenya\u2019s 47 counties are not clearly disaggregating climate change or DRR expenditures, hindering comprehensive tracking of all the budget lines. The absence of clear policy guidelines to steer long-term fiscal outlays by counties may see most of them remain chronically underfunded, exacerbating the situation.</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0</strong><strong>The participants called for the following:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Simplify the concept of climate change to local communities</em>. There was a consensus that there is need to better explain the concept and impact of climate change to local communities, to help integrate indigenous knowledge and skills in addressing the problem.</p>\n<p><em>Address inadequate public resource allocation and arbitrary fund ceiling</em>. After DI presented the findings of its analysis, the counties conceded that the amount currently being allocated to climate change and DRR is inadequate. Participants noted that most counties in Kenya commit up to 2% of their budgets for climate change, but it\u2019s not clear if this figure derives from national government, or replicates what other counties have decided to allocate. Meaningful impact in addressing climate change and DRR requires mobilisation of resources beyond allocations from the national government.</p>\n<p><em>Fast-tracking of policy and legal frameworks. </em>Both participants and co-presenters Christian Aid agreed that the lack of appropriate policy and legal frameworks poses a barrier to effective mobilisation of funds. The participants noted that County Assemblies were taking too long to enact the policies into laws.</p>\n<p><em>Going beyond budget estimates analysis</em>. Participants felt that tracking actual expenditures from allocations is critical (as allocations do not always translate into actual spending). It also emerged that data-access challenges are significant at the county level. For instance, actual expenditure data is available only at department level.</p>\n<p><em>Tracking other sources of funds</em>. Participants also identified the need to track funds that are separate to county government funds. These were said to include funds from development partners. Tracking all the funds and projects implemented will promote transparency and accountability, helping counties to attract more funding.</p>\n<p><em>Strengthening county data and information system</em>. Quality county data is hard to obtain (largely due to the lack of a functioning data and information management system in some counties). This impacts on evidence-informed planning.</p>\n<p><em>Strengthening partnerships</em>. Stronger partnership with key stakeholders would help:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>sustain advocacy strategy to influence county budget allocations;</li>\n<li>support counties to adopt international standards when mainstreaming/designing local policy and legal frameworks</li>\n<li>track performance of projects at the county level.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For key recommendations, read our reports:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/county-drr-budget-tracking-kenya/\" target=\"_blank\">Tracking subnational government investments in disaster risk reduction in Kenya</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/tracking-subnational-government-investments-climate-change-mitigation-adaptation-kenya/\" target=\"_blank\">Tracking subnational government investments in climate change mitigation and adaptation in Kenya</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p id=\"yui_3_16_0_1_1560931157273_1633\"><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/water_alternatives/42884203580/in/photolist-bSxE8i-28kwKEm-WNUgGz-WBaYjV\" target=\"_blank\">Photo: V.

The UK\u2019s Department for International Development (DFID) has been a longstanding champion of global nutrition and has provided leadership for <a href=\"https://nutritionforgrowth.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Nutrition for Growth</a> (N4G) since its inception in 2013. This month marks exactly six years since N4G was agreed. Led by the UK government alongside other partners, this historic Global Nutrition for Growth Compact was endorsed by 100 stakeholders including governments, businesses, CSOs and others. Now, crucially, we are just one year away from the 2020 N4G Summit in Tokyo \u2013 the deadline for stakeholders to deliver on their current N4G commitments. This will also be the moment when a new set of commitments will be made, making it a critical time for tracking progress.</p>\n<p>As part of their efforts to monitor and evaluate their work, DFID commissions independent annual analysis of their nutrition spending, and the latest report has just been published. This detailed report tells us how much they are investing in nutrition and where it is going. It tells us whether DFID is meeting its commitments and living up to making nutrition a priority.</p>\n<p>As you will see below, overall, there are clear positive trends in DFID\u2019s spending on nutrition, not least in delivery against their N4G commitments.</p>\n<h4>DFID has exceeded its nutrition-sensitive N4G commitment</h4>\n<h5>Figure 1.

This largely accounts for which countries receive the largest volume of nutrition ODA overall \u2013 Yemen, South Sudan and Somalia are the top three. While five fewer countries received nutrition disbursements in 2017 than the year before, spending increased across 17 countries, largely due to humanitarian needs.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, while emergency food aid accounted for the biggest single proportion of nutrition spending at US$149.2 million, this area saw a notable drop compared to the year before. At the same time, there has been a marked increase in disbursements to disaster prevention and preparedness activities, to a peak of US$37.3 million, attributable to greater disbursements to the Multi-Year Humanitarian Programme in Somalia. With <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/global-humanitarian-assistance-report-2018/\" target=\"_blank\">growing emphasis on the need for multi-year funding in crisis contexts</a>, it is positive to see increasing funds to nutrition are going to such programmes.</p>\n<h4>Recipients of ODA would benefit from knowing what is coming</h4>\n<p>One area where we see a negative trend is that the amounts of ODA that DFID committed (i.e. a formal obligation made to disburse funds) to nutrition has dropped. While there may be valid reasons for donors not wanting to commit spending too far in advance, recipients of ODA greatly benefit from knowing that it is coming, and DFID should strive to provide this where possible.</p>\n<h4>Overall we are seeing a really positive picture from the latest spending figures</h4>\n<p>DFID is living up to its promise to make global nutrition a continued priority and, by delivering on that promise, is giving the UK a strong platform to champion nutrition globally and lead the way on action to tackling <a href=\"https://globalnutritionreport.org/reports/global-nutrition-report-2018/burden-malnutrition/\" target=\"_blank\">the huge challenges faced by every country</a> in ensuring their populations are nourished.</p>\n<p>Read the full report:\u00a0<a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/dfids-aid-spending-nutrition-2017/\" target=\"_blank\">DFID\u2019s aid spending for nutrition: 2017</a></p>\n<p><em>This analysis was carried out as part of Development Initiatives\u2019 work under the MQSUN+ consortium. </em></p>\n<p><em>MQSUN+\u00a0is supported by</em>\u00a0<em>UKaid through the Department of International Development; however, the views expressed do not necessarily reflect the UK Government\u2019s official policies.

The <a href=\"https://centre.humdata.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Centre for Humanitarian Data</a> and <a href=\"http://devinit.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Development Initiatives</a> co-hosted the event to review progress and the future direction of the Grand Bargain\u2019s Transparency Workstream.</p>\n<p>As part of the <a href=\"https://www.agendaforhumanity.org/initiatives/3861\" target=\"_blank\">Grand Bargain agreement</a>, organisations signed up to publish timely, transparent, harmonised, open and high-quality data on humanitarian funding and activities using the <a href=\"https://iatistandard.org/en/about/iati-standard/\" target=\"_blank\">International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI)</a> as the basis for a common standard. Transparency is sometimes seen as a technical and abstract concept, and publishing data using the IATI Standard is an investment we are often asked to defend in our own organisations. The focus of the event\u2019s workshops on data use was therefore timely, as it helped us reflect on the practical value of transparency.</p>\n<p>Using a common data standard is like a group of people assembling a jigsaw puzzle. Everyone has to consider how their own pieces fit together (this can take time in itself) then add them to the collective picture. Donors are the corners and edge pieces (sometimes the easiest to do!) but the picture of how aid flows requires all other actors to add their pieces into the middle. While jigsaws are just attractive pictures, the power of transparency is that \u2013 by building the puzzle \u2013 individual actors can make better decisions: co-ordinating better, monitoring changes we want to make, advocating for greater efficiencies.</p>\n<p>Conveying this message is key both to getting senior management buy\u2010in and within the context of federated and complex organisations. The workshops\u2019 examples presented on how reporting to IATI has contributed to improving systems and reporting processes, and promoted internal data culture shifts, including the encouraging outcomes of the <a href=\"https://centre.humdata.org/lessons-from-connecting-iati-and-fts/\" target=\"_blank\">IATI-FTS integration pilot</a>, will provide valuable use cases. It was exciting to see the new prototypes and data visualisation tools which will make IATI data more accessible and digestible. They are a tangible example of the value of reporting more granular humanitarian data to IATI and have the potential to incentivise progress on other Grand Bargain commitments. It was interesting to think about the principles of responsible data and reflect on how we apply them to our current IATI practices.</p>\n<p>Finally, it was great to discuss and think about the future as a community, recognising that greater transparency is a means to achieving the collective goals of better decision-making and increased efficiency. In this respect, we look forward to reading upcoming research from <a href=\"https://www.publishwhatyoufund.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Publish What You Fund</a>, which aims to better understand the data needs of national and local respondents.</p>\n<p>But there is still some work to do:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The focus on automation, although a desirable outcome from some points of view (e.g. systems interoperability), might pose the risk of excluding smaller organisations that either don\u2019t have the resources to invest in major ICT projects, or don\u2019t need to. The IATI collective is made up of many actors, of various sizes. If automation will be pursued as an outcome for the workstream, there will need to be appropriate support \u2013 both in terms of capacity-building and resources and tools \u2013 available to smaller IATI publishers. Otherwise they will be left out to the detriment of the greater goals mentioned above.</li>\n<li>We all need to work collectively towards a greater \u2018standardisation of the standard\u2019. The inherent flexibility of IATI lends itself to multiple interpretations of data fields that can in turn lead to a decrease in the usability of the data. IATI publishers need better guidance and tools, and donor requirements need to be harmonised, not diverging from the Standard, to help achieve this objective.</li>\n<li>Although IATI was originally designed to support governments with allocating their resources better, the list of IATI publishers and users has expanded considerably, mirroring the varied composition of both the development and humanitarian sectors. Civil society organisations (CSOs) make up 73%\u00a0of the total number of IATI publishers but they are often underrepresented within these high\u2010level forums due to resource constraints. CSOs\u2019 publisher and data-use needs are different from those of governments. For example; CSOs who publish data may be more interested in improving existing publishing tools such as <a href=\"https://aidstream.org/\" target=\"_blank\">AidStream</a> than in embarking on complex system integration processes. As users, CSOs will be more interested in understanding how data can be used to support decision-making on the ground. Representation of smaller, local and women-led organisations is even lower, but the collective goals can be achieved only by including all voices and providing opportunities for participation and engagement that cater for all actors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The workshops were a great opportunity to reflect on the progress made so far, and to focus on the future. When thinking about the next steps, building on the learning the event generated will be key to maintaining the momentum and making the community larger and more inclusive. It will also be important to remember that IATI data should reflect internal business processes and enable organisations to tell their own stories, where they are publishing data that truly meets their own needs. This will contribute greatly to publishers seeing how the value of IATI extends beyond mere compliance, and will help us add as many pieces as we can to the jigsaw puzzle of humanitarian and development work.</p>\n<p>Photo credit:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldbank/14344707682/\" target=\"_blank\">\u00a9 2014 Dominic Chavez/World Bank</a></p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "What people want: building resilience and stabilit...", "author": [], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "04 Jun 2019", "description": "DFID\u2019s Matthew Wyatt and Barbara Lecq talk about efforts to make our development, humanitarian and peacebuilding investments coherent", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/people-want-building-resilience-stability-conflict-crises/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"><p>This guest blog was contributed by Matthew Wyatt, Deputy Director and Head of Conflict, Humanitarian and Security Department, and Barbara Lecq, Protracted Crises Adviser, of the UK\u2019s Department for International Development</p>\n</div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>Over the last 25 years, more than one billion people lifted themselves out of extreme poverty.<a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\">[1]</a> But this tremendous progress has not benefited all equally. People living in low-income countries, and in countries affected by conflict and fragility, are least likely to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Between 2004 and 2014, 58% of deaths from disasters occurred in the top 30 most fragile states.<a href=\"#_edn2\" name=\"_ednref2\">[2]</a> Today, nine of the ten humanitarian emergencies receiving the most humanitarian assistance worldwide are in extremely fragile countries.<a href=\"#_edn3\" name=\"_ednref3\">[3]</a> By 2030, 80% of the world\u2019s extreme poor are likely to live in fragile and conflict-affected states.</p>\n<p>Realities increasingly don\u2019t fit the neat boxes of development, humanitarian, peacebuilding and human rights action, as<a href=\"https://www.icrc.org/en/document/where-humantiarian-action-meets-peace-building\"> ICRC President Peter Maurer</a> noted recently. The UN Secretary General has gone a step further by calling on the development, peacebuilding and humanitarian systems to transcend their divisions and work more coherently to address this challenge.<a href=\"#_edn4\" name=\"_ednref4\">[4]</a> The World Humanitarian Summit (together with the initiatives it gave rise to \u2013 the Grand Bargain, the New Way of Working) and the Global Compact on Refugees have given further impetus to these efforts. This year, members of the OECD\u2019s Development Assistance Committee (DAC) adopted a <a href=\"https://legalinstruments.oecd.org/en/instruments/OECD-LEGAL-5019\">Recommendation on the humanitarian\u2013development\u2013peace nexus</a>, demonstrating donors\u2019 growing commitment to do things differently. The \u2018nexus\u2019 was also explored with other experts in a <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/emerging-trends-development-finance-mean-crisis-actors/\" target=\"_blank\">webinar recently hosted by Development Initiatives</a>.</p>\n<p>It makes sense for development and peacebuilding actors to mobilise alongside humanitarian ones in conflict and protracted crises.<strong> It is critical to go beyond saving lives and respond to people\u2019s aspirations.</strong> When people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) were given the choice of how to use aid in crises, they chose to allocate 40% of funds to improve their livelihoods and close to 9% to education \u2013 sectors traditionally considered as more developmental.<a href=\"#_edn5\" name=\"_ednref5\">[5]</a> Through the CDA project <a href=\"http://www.cdacollaborative.org/publication/time-to-listen-a-discussion-guide/\">Time to Listen</a>, people from 20 aid-recipient countries reported that their <strong>main expectations from international aid were to strengthen their economic prospects, improve political and security conditions and feel that others cared</strong>. Strikingly, people were negative about the cumulative impact of support, preferring pathways to self-sufficiency; they also recognised that over time, aid could introduce or reinforce tensions between groups in societies.</p>\n<p>The UK knows it<strong> needs to respond to these expectations.</strong><a href=\"#_edn6\" name=\"_ednref6\">[6]</a> Increasingly, we are trying to make our development, humanitarian and peacebuilding investments coherent, and to <strong>build resilience and stability.</strong> We have committed to spend 50% of our aid budget in fragile and conflict-affected states. And we are focusing our efforts on supporting the building blocks for more stable, peaceful and resilient societies: fair power structures, effective and legitimate institutions, inclusive economic development, formal and informal conflict management systems and, finally, a supportive regional and global environment.</p>\n<p>In major refugee hosting countries from Jordan and Lebanon to Ethiopia and Kenya, DFID is investing to support jobs, livelihoods, training and wider economic opportunities that benefit refugees and host communities alike. In such countries as Burma, Nigeria and Somalia, alongside our investments to address urgent humanitarian needs, we are working to make economic development more inclusive, and helping to build more accountable and resilient health and education services, and more effective and legitimate institutions. We also support mediation between conflict actors and peacebuilding.</p>\n<p>Across multiple countries, <strong>we are helping societies put in place formal and informal conflict resolution mechanisms</strong> that can reduce violence and strengthen women\u2019s role in building peace. For example, in Burma and the DRC we are working to increase the capacity of the civil society, women, youth and minority groups to engage in social cohesion projects that strengthen trust and lay the foundations for sustainable peace.</p>\n<p>DFID\u2019s support to <strong>social protection</strong> systems in 23 countries is helping poor and vulnerable people build more productive and resilient livelihoods, and governments to build shock-responsive systems, such as the Kenya Hunger Safety Net Programme that can scale up its cash transfers to protect vulnerable people when shocks hit.</p>\n<p>But this is only the start of our efforts, and we must do more collectively to help people in conflict and crises lift themselves out of poverty and need. We must focus on three priorities.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Getting the financing right</strong> to support resilience, prevention and stability is essential for progress. Countries such as Chad and Sudan have received humanitarian financing for decades, but development spend to build resilience has remained very low.</li>\n<li>Development, peacebuilding and humanitarian financing should <strong>all be making a positive contribution to building resilience and stability</strong>.</li>\n<li>We need the <strong>right analytical and data tools</strong> to do the job well, and to avoid doing harm.</li>\n<li>Finally, and most importantly, <strong>we must make people\u2019s and civil society\u2019s voices central to our work</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We are working with bilateral, multilateral and civil society partners to try and make new approaches to conflict and crises a reality. We also hope that the OECD DAC can play a significant role to help donors and others make progress on this critical agenda.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/dfid/31844163194\" target=\"_blank\">Photo:\u00a0Russell Watkins/DFID</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\"></a></p>\n</div><div class=\"row--cards\" ng-if=\"post.notes\">\n<div class=\"col-md-12 card m-b--2\">\n<div class=\"card__content bg--light\">\n<h3 class=\"h3\">Notes</h3>\n<div> <p><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\">[1]</a>\u00a0World Bank (2018), \u2018Decline of Global Extreme Poverty Continues but Has Slowed: World Bank\u2019.

As global actors gather in New York this week for <a href=\"https://www.un.org/ecosoc/en/events/2019/ffd-forum\" target=\"_blank\">the fourth Financing for Development Follow Up Forum</a>, we reflect on some of the key challenges actors are facing and what needs to happen to get financing on track to help deliver Agenda 2030.</p>\n<p>The recently published <a href=\"https://developmentfinance.un.org/sites/developmentfinance.un.org/files/FSDR2019.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Financing for Sustainable Development Report 2019</em></a> warns that mobilising sufficient financing remains a major challenge in implementing Agenda 2030; despite signs of progress, investments critical to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) remain under-funded. The report strongly asserts that \u201cthe international community should make use of this opportunity to reshape both national and international financial systems in line with sustainable development. If we fail to do so, we will fail to deliver the 2030 Agenda.\u201d The conclusions of this report clearly echo those from Development Initiatives\u2019 report <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/investments-to-end-poverty-2018/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Investments to End Poverty 2018</em></a> and our follow-up factsheet <em><a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/refocus-oda-end-poverty-meet-sdgs/\" target=\"_blank\">Six ways to refocus ODA to end poverty</a></em>.</p>\n<p>Both reports, looking comprehensively at financing for development, point to three key challenges that we must overcome if we are to <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/p20-initiative-data-to-leave-no-one-behind/\" target=\"_blank\">close the growing inequality between the poorest people and the rest,</a> and so <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/investments-to-end-poverty-2018/#chapter-1-new-mindsets-for-investments-to-end-poverty\" target=\"_blank\">ensure hundreds of millions of women, men and children are not left behind in extreme poverty</a>:</p>\n<h3>1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We need to better target resources</h3>\n<p>Financing for development is a scarce resource, as the <a href=\"https://developmentfinance.un.org/sites/developmentfinance.un.org/files/FSDR2019.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Financing for Sustainable Development Report 2019</em></a> highlights. And that makes using finance effectively ever more critical. To improve the poverty projections described above, resources must be used effectively to maximise impact. <strong>In the context of leaving no one behind, that means reaching the furthest behind first, and that means better targeting resources.</strong></p>\n<p>There are a multitude of ways this needs to happen, from investing in the vital human capital sectors of health, education and social protection to providing support for efforts to increase domestic public resources. Crucially, to leave no one behind, <strong>governments and donors will need to focus on better targeting resources to reach the poorest and most vulnerable people <em>within</em> countries</strong>. As outlined in a newly published report by Development Initiatives and the Overseas Development Institute on <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/subnational-investment-human-capital/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Subnational investment in human capital</em></a>, the (very limited) data available shows that international and domestic public resources do not preferentially target the poorest regions and the poorest people<em>.</em></p>\n<h3>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Greater investment in human capital and human development is needed</h3>\n<p>Public resources, both domestic and international, are particularly important in funding the interventions critical to tackling extreme poverty and inequality \u2013 they can be directly targeted at reducing poverty and are redistributive in nature. Other resources have an important and complementary role to play \u2013 as explored in more detail in <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/investments-to-end-poverty-2018/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Investments to End Poverty</em></a> \u2013 but they cannot substitute for public investment in vital human capital development and basic social service provision. The future jobs, wealth and wellbeing of people depend on these investments in health, education, nutrition and social protection, for example. And yet, <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/oda-domestic-resource-mobilisation-working/\" target=\"_blank\">support for domestic resource mobilisation remains insufficient</a> and <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/final-oda-data-2018-message/\" target=\"_blank\">global aid has fallen for the second year running</a>. In particular, <a href=\"https://developmentfinance.un.org/sites/developmentfinance.un.org/files/FSDR2019_ChptIII-C.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">social spending has fallen as a percentage of total Official Development Assistance (ODA), from 40% in 2010 to 35% in 2017</a>. The targeting of ODA is not always in line with need. For example, in 2017, donors spent a lower proportion of ODA on education in the poorest countries: <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/refocus-oda-end-poverty-meet-sdgs/\" target=\"_blank\">7% of total ODA to Least Developed Countries (LDCs), but 11% in Upper-Middle Income Countries (UMICs)</a>.</p>\n<h3>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We need better data to ensure no one is left behind</h3>\n<p>The first step in leaving no one behind is to ensure that everyone is counted, through comprehensive civil registration and vital statistics systems (CRVS). There also needs to be greater investment in the collection, analysis and use of data that is disaggregated (at a minimum) by income, gender, geographic location, age and disability, in order to identify the groups and individuals most likely to be left behind. <strong>Better data on people living in poverty will enable evidence-based decisions</strong> on resource allocations and help to target interventions towards the poorest.</p>\n<h3>What action needs to be taken in New York this week?</h3>\n<p>This week\u2019s Financing for Development Forum in New York should be a wake-up call to all involved to take stock and take action. Four years into the SDG era, it is clear that collective action is falling well short in mobilising the financing essential to delivering Agenda 2030. To end poverty, reduce inequality and ensure no one is left behind, those gathering in New York this week must focus on <strong>how to mobilise more resources and target them more effectively towards the people and places that need them most.\u00a0 </strong></p>\n<p>While the current political context is challenging, and governments in the North and the South have many other things on their minds, there is no excuse for inaction. If we fail to change direction now \u2013 as the <a href=\"https://developmentfinance.un.org/sites/developmentfinance.un.org/files/FSDR2019.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Financing for Sustainable Development Report 2019</em></a> points out \u2013 we will fail to deliver the 2030 Agenda, and fail to deliver on the promises we made to the world\u2019s poorest people.

By 2030, a larger proportion of the world\u2019s poor are set to reside in fragile and protracted crisis contexts. Crises are becoming increasingly protracted and complex in nature, with humanitarian assistance often going to the same crisis year-on-year, and this trend has led to increasing consensus among policy-makers on the need for longer-term development responses in crisis contexts, and more joined-up approaches to strengthen effectiveness. Greater coherence between development, crisis and peace agendas is needed to enable progress towards the common goal to \u2018leave no one behind\u2019. This is particularly so for protracted crisis contexts, where short-term humanitarian and longer-term development responses more commonly overlap.</p>\n<p>At the international level there is commitment to strengthen joined-up approaches (of which programming and financing, together with joint analysis and planning, are critical components). An array of international commitments for achieving greater coherence and \u2018collective outcomes\u2019 have emerged, including the \u2018New Way of Working\u2019 and Grand Bargain, Agenda 2030 and the <a href=\"https://legalinstruments.oecd.org/public/doc/643/643.en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Development Assistance Committee recommendation on the \u2018humanitarian-development-peace nexus\u2019</a>.</p>\n<p>But the real challenge remains delivery. While there have been efforts at the country level to action these commitments (such as the delivery of the New Way of Working at the country level and of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee Task Team on the Humanitarian Development Nexus), and at the international level to establish new multi-year global funds and financing mechanisms that work at the interface of crisis and development response (e.g. the World Bank\u2019s Global Concessional Financing Framework, Financing Action Mechanism and the scale-up of IDA 18), evidence on their effectiveness and impact is patchy, and approaches are not yet systematised.</p>\n<p>To move the discussion forward and to strengthen joined-up approaches to financing across development and crisis sectors, DI is organising a series of webinars to bring together both sets of actors into the same forum and identify more concrete ways to overcome barriers and strengthen coherence in financing approaches.</p>\n<p>The first webinar, <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/what-do-emerging-trends-in-development-finance-mean-for-crisis-actors/\" target=\"_blank\">\u2018<em>What do development finance trends mean for crisis financing actors?</em>\u2019</a>, will provide actors working in fragile and crisis contexts with the opportunity to hear from development and crisis finance experts and explore the possibilities for joint working towards financing for collective outcomes.</p>\n<p>There are several pressing and unresolved questions regarding the practical application of coherent financing that will be posed as central themes of the webinar series:</p>\n<h4>Development actors engaging at different stages of crises</h4>\n<p>There is agreement that longer-term responses are increasingly important in protracted crises, but at what phase of the crisis is the engagement of development actors most effective and based on what data/indicators? How should development finance complement humanitarian assistance in a protracted crisis? Should development actors continue to engage in crisis contexts working coherently with crisis actors, given an assumption that sustained development engagement is critical for preventing the embedding of protracted crises?</p>\n<h4>Planning and delivering development assistance in fragile and protracted crises</h4>\n<p>With a greater proportion of the world\u2019s poorest people set to reside in fragile and protracted crisis countries by 2030, development actors are presumably going to be under increased pressure to target resources to complex crisis contexts and work coherently with crisis actors \u2013 what does this mean for the way development actors plan and deliver assistance?</p>\n<h4>The impact of global funding mechanisms working at the interface between crisis and development response</h4>\n<p>New global funding mechanisms are emerging, aimed at strengthening financing across the development\u2013crisis nexus, such as the Global Concessional Financing Facility and new World Bank Famine Action Mechanism, but what is the potential for them becoming transformational, more widely applied and scaled up? What is the impact of these instruments to date on crisis-affected people? Evidence has so far been limited.</p>\n<h4>Changing the way crises are funded</h4>\n<p>There is increased support among donors to prioritise \u2018development where possible and humanitarian assistance only when necessary\u2019 (as outlined in DFID\u2019s protracted crisis discussion paper and the OECD\u2019s 2018 States of Fragility report) but in the current context \u2013 where most crises are protracted and receive humanitarian assistance year-on-year \u2013 what does this mean for the way crisis response is funded, and what needs to shift?</p>\n<p>These overarching questions will provide a frame for the webinar discussions, but we are keen to ensure that the conversation is as inclusive as possible. We welcome the submission of additional questions for consideration in the webinars by experts across crisis and development sectors.

Three prominent aid organisations of the 59 donors and humanitarian aid organisations who have signed the agreement \u2013 the International Committee of the Red Cross, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \u2013 have started publishing data on their spending to the <a href=\"https://iatistandard.org/\" target=\"_blank\">International Aid Transparency Initiative</a> (IATI) in the last six months. They join the ranks of Grand Bargain signatories who are making good on the transparency commitment, which comprises one of the ten commitment areas that make up the Grand Bargain as a whole. But publishing data is only one part of the transparency commitment. If decision-making, accountability and learning are going to be better informed by data, that data needs to be accessible and usable. This is where efforts now need to be focused.</p>\n<p>As at 2 January 2019:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>47 of 59 (80%) Grand Bargain signatories \u2013 or one or more of their affiliates or members \u2013 were publishing open data via IATI</li>\n<li>over 90% of those publishing were including some data on their humanitarian activities</li>\n<li>over 83% of those publishing are currently using v2.02 (which allows publishers to flag humanitarian activities, include GLIDEnumbers and to report on funding for humanitarian response plans or clusters) or v2.03 (which has the same functionalities as mentioned above for v2.02, and also allows for reporting on pledges as well as earmarking and cash). This could rise to 89% in the next six months as Canada, the Netherlands and the UK are considering upgrades to v2.03.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Full details can be seen in our\u00a0<a class=\"pdf-download\" href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Grand-Bargain-progress-update.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Grand-Bargain-transparency-workstream-Progress-report-June-2018.pdf\">overview graphic of progress so far</a>.</p>\n<p>This is good news, as it means organisations are making steps towards fulfilling their Grand Bargain commitments. It should also make a greater quantity of open data available for analysis, monitoring and decision-making. There is of course room for further growth with more signatory members and affiliates starting to publish, and a growing number of donors (Belgium, the Netherlands and the UK, for example) making IATI publication a condition of funding. As more Grand Bargain signatories, members and affiliates publish via the <a href=\"https://iatistandard.org/en/using-data/IATI-tools-and-resources/IATI-datastore/\" target=\"_blank\">IATI registry</a>\u00a0the volume of data available for use will increase.</p>\n<p>However, equally important \u2013 and more pressing at this stage \u2013 is the need to ensure that the humanitarian data published is usable, useful and accessible. If it isn\u2019t, the chances of it being taken up by users is low, and the chance of it having meaningful impact is even lower.</p>\n<p>Making standardised data \u2013 data that uses the same format and definitions \u2013 more readily available should help reduce not only the reporting burden on the publisher \u2013 who can publish once for multiple users and uses \u2013 but also the collection, cleaning, curation and research burden on the user. How much of an impact this approach would have in practice is being put to the test via the <a href=\"https://centre.humdata.org/connecting-iati-and-fts-for-streamlined-humanitarian-reporting/\" target=\"_blank\">IATI-FTS pilot</a>, a collaboration with the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs <a href=\"https://fts.unocha.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Financial Tracking Service</a> (FTS), the <a href=\"https://centre.humdata.org\" target=\"_blank\">Centre for Humanitarian Data</a> and five Grand Bargain signatories. All eyes are on this pilot \u2013 which has just seen the successful import of the first batch of data from the US Agency for International Development \u2013 to gauge the benefits for all involved, and the benefits that might accrue for the end user, such as quality and timeliness of the curated data. In particular, we are keen to see if the data that is readily available from the IATI registry can help FTS in its quest to speed up the process of collation and curation in order to focus resources on analysis \u2013 and if pilot participants find that this same data does indeed serve multiple purposes.</p>\n<p>The uptake and use of data published via IATI will depend on its usability, usefulness and accessibility. How might the data support decision-makers? How might it help with policy, programming, monitoring, research, evaluation or advocacy objectives? How does it complement existing data, platforms and tools? What are the barriers to use? The Development Initiatives (DI) team <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/projects/monitoring-grand-bargain-commitment-transparency/\" target=\"_blank\">is working to support the transparency workstream co-convenors</a> \u2013 the Netherlands and the World Bank \u2013 with a view to raising awareness of IATI\u2019s potential within the evolving humanitarian and data landscapes, as well as to gauging current perceptions and actual use. As an essential first step, we are conducting an online <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf8K3veEeUj9xSRjeXcGEi5BiCv_EsB01NyA3E_fqPGV9xW2A/viewform\" target=\"_blank\">survey</a>, the results of which will inform the 2019 Grand Bargain independent annual report. Open for responses until 22 March, the survey is aimed primarily at Grand Bargain signatories \u2013 but other stakeholders are also welcome to participate, and we are happy to receive more than one response per organisation. Alongside this, and in consultation with other Grand Bargain workstreams, we are also prototyping \u2018windows\u2019 onto the IATI data to show what\u2019s available and what might be possible if more, and more usable, data was being published. We will be sharing progress and findings throughout the year \u2013 including at the transparency workstream workshop in May, which aims to convene Grand Bargain and IATI stakeholders.</p>\n<p><a class=\"pdf-download\" href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Grand-Bargain-progress-update.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Grand-Bargain-transparency-workstream-Progress-report-June-2018.pdf\">View an overview graphic of progress so far</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf8K3veEeUj9xSRjeXcGEi5BiCv_EsB01NyA3E_fqPGV9xW2A/viewform\" target=\"_blank\">Respond to our Grand Bargain transparency workstream survey</a></p>\n<p>If you\u2019d like to be involved in our work, share experiences or examples of data use, or ask any questions about the transparency workstream, contact DI\u2019s Senior Policy &amp; Engagement Advisor <a href=\"mailto:Angus%20Urquhart%20%3cAngus.Urquhart@devinit.org%3e\">Angus Urquhart</a>.</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "UN appeals: What does underfunding really mean?", "author": ["Chris Degnan", "Sophia Swithern"], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "07 Feb 2019", "description": "UN-coordinated appeals produce the largest combined global request for funding. But the size of that request is out-pacing funding contributions.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/un-appeals-underfunding-really-mean/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>UN-coordinated appeals are a central pillar of the humanitarian response architecture. Each year they bring together hundreds of humanitarian agencies (nearly 800 of them at the last count) to produce the largest combined global request for funding.</p>\n<p>But the size of that request is out-pacing funding contributions. In 2018, the appeals called for just under US$25 billion to meet the needs of an estimated 98 million crisis-affected people. This was almost double the amount requested just six years before. Despite major increases in humanitarian assistance, by the end of 2018 there was a record US$10.9 billion shortfall. Funding is under pressure \u2013 as the <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/global-humanitarian-assistance-report-2018/\" target=\"_blank\">Global Humanitarian Assistance Report 2018</a>\u00a0shows, it is failing to keep up with increasing demands, and is distributed unequally, concentrated to a few large crises.</p>\n<p>The underfunding problem is not new and is well-recognised by humanitarian agencies and by donors alike. It has prompted much debate and many initiatives to try to fill the gap. Yet, while the <strong>scale</strong> of underfunding is well-reported, we know considerably less about its <strong>impacts</strong>. What does a 40% funding gap mean for the provision of assistance to the people who need it? How does <strong>money not given</strong> translate into <strong>response not delivered</strong> and into <strong>needs not met</strong>? Inability to answer these questions fuels ongoing mutual frustration between donors and agencies \u2013 donors distrust the numbers behind the appeals, while agencies struggle with shortfalls and compete for funds.</p>\n<p>To begin to get beyond this circular crisis of trust, our latest report <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/understanding-appeals-underfunding/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Underfunded appeals: understanding the consequences, improving the system</em></a> (commissioned by the <a href=\"https://eba.se/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Swedish Expert Group for Aid Studies</a>) sought to examine what is known and unknown about the consequences of underfunding \u2013 why it is so hard to answer this question and what does this tell us about how the system behind the appeals could improve. We looked in detail at three countries with underfunded appeals of quite different sizes: Chad, Haiti and Somalia.</p>\n<p>Faced with shortfalls, humanitarian agencies fundraise, advocate, redistribute if they can, perform \u201cfinancial gymnastics\u201d and cut back their planned assistance. Reviewing the documents and speaking to humanitarians in each country, we saw that underfunding undermines the localisation, presence and effectiveness of the response. For people affected by crisis, shortfalls erode resilience \u2013 pushing people to deplete their resources and so face acute need when the next shock happens. We saw how cuts in food rations increase not only malnutrition, but also threats to protection and security.</p>\n<p>While these impacts of underfunding are regularly observed by agencies, they are not systematically reported. The evidence tends to be patchy, illustrative and ad hoc \u2013 narrated in the disparate updates, reports, dashboards and reviews which make up each country\u2019s appeals cycle. Although this is arguably unsurprising and understandable \u2013 measuring the outcomes of action, let alone inaction, in complex settings is extremely challenging, and all the more so when there is no funding or presence to do so \u2013 it is not insurmountable.</p>\n<p>This knowledge gap about the realities of the funding shortfall has implications for improving the appeals system: for the way that the requirements are generated, that funding is tracked, and that the response is monitored and reported. The appeals have evolved almost beyond recognition since their inception over a quarter of a century ago, and there are many ongoing efforts to make them smarter and more consistent. But these need to go further \u2013 with clearer costings, more consistent revisions, and better monitoring and reporting.</p>\n<p>All of these improvements do involve trade-offs \u2013 especially when funds are tight \u2013 between investing in more coordination or in more response. They will also be meaningless unless they are used \u2013 in particular to better and more rationally fund the appeals. So, improvements on the appeal-side must go hand-in-hand with improvements on the donor-side: with greater investments in the flexible and pooled funds that help to meet the worst gaps; and with better donor coordination to avoid the inequities that accumulate from bilateral preferences.</p>\n<p>There are, of course, clear limits to what technical fixes can achieve. They neither address the underlying political economy of the humanitarian system nor solve the problem of addressing underlying needs, and they do not help the world to shift from a crisis-based model of funding response to a risk-based model of reducing need. But while the appeals cannot be seen in isolation of the wider aid system, this does not reduce the current critical importance of donors and agencies working together to get them right. For people in need of humanitarian assistance, the stakes are high.</p>\n<p>Photo credit:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/eu_echo/8229628377/in/album-72157647257623573/\" target=\"_blank\">\u00a9 EU 2012- Photo credits: EC/ECHO/Isabel Coello</a></p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "How can blended financing help the world\u2019s poore...", "author": ["Cecilia Caio"], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "04 Feb 2019", "description": "Investigating the role that blended financing can play in addressing financing needs in developing countries to help the poorest people.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/blended-financing-help-worlds-poorest/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"><p>This blog originally appeared on <a href=\"https://www.bond.org.uk/news/2019/01/how-can-blended-financing-help-the-worlds-poorest\" target=\"_blank\">Bond\u2019s website</a>.</p>\n</div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>We are off-track to achieve Agenda 2030 and urgent cross-sector action is needed particularly for the poorest people and places.

This was the sobering starting point of a recent roundtable hosted by DI, the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) and the Private Infrastructure Development Group (PIDG) in London.\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.uncdf.org/bfldcs/home\" target=\"_blank\">UNCDF\u2019s report on Blended Finance in LDCs</a> provided additional insight into the trends, challenges and opportunities of this type of financing in these particular contexts.</p>\n<h4>Key questions</h4>\n<p>There was a lively evidence-based debate on some of the key questions that remain to be adequately addressed if we want to move forward in ensuring that the right type of finance is mobilised for the right type of interventions between now and 2030.</p>\n<p>The need to be honest about where blended finance can and cannot be effective in reducing poverty was highlighted. Given that official development assistance (ODA) is a finite resource, where do we prioritise blended finance over other uses, such as direct programming in countries?</p>\n<p>Another area we need to interrogate is the ability of blended instruments (such as syndicated loans and shares in collective investment vehicles) to bring in vast amounts of additional private financing[1]. A more open and nuanced conversation is needed around what we are trying to achieve and where. For example, if it\u2019s not mobilising \u201ctrillions\u201d\u00a0in private investment, is blending supporting other outcomes such as private sector entry into previously untapped markets? Or is it enabling development finance institutions (like the CDC Group) or multilateral development banks (like the World Bank) to\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.uncdf.org/bfldcs/action-agenda\" target=\"_blank\">take more risks and experiment more</a>?</p>\n<h4>The challenge</h4>\n<p>It\u2019s obvious that there are no easy answers to these questions but it\u2019s just as obvious that strengthening transparency and developing countries\u2019 ownership of the blended finance agenda could go a long way in moving the conversation forward. Encouragingly, there is a clear desire and willingness to do better and to work together on these fronts.</p>\n<p>Beyond the London roundtable, conversations in Paris at the OECD\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-topics/private-finance-for-sustainable-development.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Private Finance 4 Sustainable Development Week</a>\u00a0confirmed this too. The imperative seems to have shifted from leverage to impact, meaning more attention is being given to what blended finance can actually achieve.</p>\n<p>Now the challenge will be to avoid what was often referred to as \u2019impact washing\u2019, where businesses or organisations exaggerate their impact claims or even use impact claims to conceal practices with negative effects. We must ensure that the needs of people in developing countries, particularly those most at risk of being left behind, remain front and centre of policymaking and practice.</p>\n<p>We still need to shed more light on some of the specifics around blended finance as a financing approach to the \u2018leave no one behind\u2019 agenda, including what problems it is better placed to solve compared to purely public or purely private approaches. There is also a big gap in evidence and discourse on what the channels are through which blending can reach the poorest people, and crucially, the time it takes for them to reap the benefits. Against the backdrop of\u00a0<a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/2017-oda-data/\" target=\"_blank\">already concerning trends in ODA</a>, filling this evidence gap becomes all the more urgent.</p>\n<p>At DI we\u2019ll be doing our part to contribute to broadening available data and information in this area to enable a more evidence-based discourse, and drive ODA allocations toward interventions that can benefit the poorest people first.</p>\n<p><em>Find out about\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.bond.org.uk/sessions/new-routes-to-financing-your-programmes\" target=\"_blank\">other innovative ways of financing development programmes</a>\u00a0at the Bond Conference, 18\u201319 March</em>.</p>\n<p>Photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/usaid_images/18087237344/in/photolist-tyiPvJ-tyiMcf-uvk5D8\" target=\"_blank\">USAID</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</div><div class=\"row--cards\" ng-if=\"post.notes\">\n<div class=\"col-md-12 card m-b--2\">\n<div class=\"card__content bg--light\">\n<h3 class=\"h3\">Notes</h3>\n<div> <p>[1]\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.odi.org/comment/10650-can-blended-finance-work-poorest-countries\">Forthcoming research from ODI</a>\u00a0looks at available data on this.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Development cooperation for improved data", "author": ["Harpinder Collacott"], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "11 Dec 2018", "description": "DI Executive Director Harpinder Collacott reflects on some key aspects of the OECD's latest Development Cooperation Report", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/development-cooperation-improved-data/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>This last week has been an important one for the OECD\u2019s Development Assistance Committee (DAC), seeing both the appointment of a new Chair and the publication of the <a href=\"http://oe.cd/dcr2018\" target=\"_blank\">latest edition of the Development Co-operation Report</a>.

Steps toward improving the available data include raising the standard for data sources beyond household surveys alone, increasing the coverage of civil registration and vital statistics systems, and in particular increasing the proportion of data that is disaggregated by gender, age, geography and disability. The report also highlights that, as data ecosystems of producers and users become more complex, the guiding principles of the <a href=\"http://www.data4sdgs.org/initiatives/inclusive-data-charter\" target=\"_blank\">Inclusive Data Charter</a> are becoming only more important.</p>\n<p>Data collection and use are important areas for development cooperation because they are challenges that require significant financial and technical resources \u2013 and which also benefit from the accumulated experience of different national governments. Only 56 of the 102\u00a0countries with statistical plans have secured adequate financing to implement those plans to date, highlighting the need for effective cooperation in this area.</p>\n<p>But beyond financial resources, there must also be a recognition that SDG1 and SDG10 set a new agenda for poverty eradication that is universal, and recognises inequality in every country. When it comes to data collection, no government has a perfect insight into poverty and inequality within its borders \u2013 so every country has something to gain from, and most have something to contribute to, mutual learning. In broad terms, what is required is not just a change in behaviour but a change in mindset. The report gives evidence that some development partners have already recognised this need and are acting on it.</p>\n<p>One method for approaching this complex task featured in the report is applying the <a href=\"http://devinit.org/p20i/\" target=\"_blank\">P20 approach</a>. The P20 approach can be applied globally <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/p20-in-my-country/\" target=\"_blank\">and in every country</a>, and focuses attention on the poorest 20% of people wherever they are. It also proposes that development partners focus on building better data on key indicators of progress for those at risk of being left behind: working to first establish meaningful baselines and then expand their data collection and use in a way that benefits the poorest people first.</p>\n<p>We were pleased to contribute data and analysis to the report\u2019s <a href=\"https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/development/development-co-operation-report-2018_dcr-2018-en#page184\" target=\"_blank\">case study on Benin</a>, which focuses on how the country\u2019s government has been working with their development partner Switzerland (who have also applied the P20 approach in their own country) and DI. Having recognised that progress is not proportionately benefitting the poorest people in Benin, the government has made leaving no one behind a cardinal principle of public policy \u2013 and a part of this has been collecting and using data to identify and monitor progress among populations at risk of being left behind. Through applying the P20 approach, <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/how-the-p20-are-doing-in-benin/\" target=\"_blank\">Benin has learned more about the poorest quintile</a> \u2013 ranging from economic data on consumption, to health data reflecting progress on stunting.</p>\n<p>Applying the P20 approach has also meant recognising and addressing data gaps in Benin \u2013 a process carried out with the assistance of Switzerland, a development partner well-placed to offer advice. Benin has made progress in this area \u2013 since 2014, 85% of children under 5 have had their birth registered \u2013 but more needs to be done. It\u2019s encouraging to see the OECD recognising the commitment of both countries to better data for leaving no one behind, and sharing a mode of development cooperation that is well-aligned with the SDGs. The challenge now is to scale up these good practice examples to see greater global progress.</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Five key points from Africa Statistics Week in Uga...", "author": ["Bernard Sabiti"], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "23 Nov 2018", "description": "DI's Bernard Sabiti shares key messages from Africa Statistics Week in Uganda and what they mean in the context of the country's unique data ecosystem.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/five-key-points-africa-statistics-week-uganda/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>Between 13 and 18 November the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) marked Africa Statistics Week with a series of events in Kampala. The seven-day event is an extension of <a href=\"https://www.uneca.org/african-statistics-day-2018\" target=\"_blank\">African Statistics Day</a>, which was initiated in 1990 to raise public awareness of the importance of statistics in all aspects of socioeconomic and environmental life. The event highlighted the role that statistics can play in national development, and brought together data producers and users, policy makers, media and civil society to discuss how to widen and modernise Uganda\u2019s National Statistics System (NSS), build partnerships and leverage technology to improve data production and use for national development.</p>\n<p>Similar to last year when we co-organised the <a href=\"https://www.ubos.org/hlndf/\" target=\"_blank\">High-Level National Data Forum</a> with UBOS as part of Africa Statistics Week, Development Initiatives (DI) was again part of this year\u2019s events. We moderated some of the panels, provided commentary on data use drawing on our experience working in Uganda over the last five years, and demonstrated some of our resources such as the <a href=\"http://data.devinit.org/spotlight-on-uganda\" target=\"_blank\">Spotlight on Uganda</a> data visualisation tool.</p>\n<p>The week-long event highlighted the important progress Uganda\u2019s data ecosystem has made: increasing funding for statistics; widening thematic scope of data production; improving human resource capacity to produce, disseminate, and use data in decision-making; and increasing the number of surveys being done.\u00a0 Workshops also highlighted the challenges that still bedevil data production and use in the country, from poor data quality to a lack of access by users and the limited involvement of new producers and users that hitherto had been outside the traditional NSS in key data production and use processes.</p>\n<p>These issues were discussed in detail over the course of the week, and remedies suggested for the challenges. I was particularly struck by the following five points, which were notable for the unanimity of opinion they generated throughout the events.</p>\n<p><strong>1. The media are a critical element of the national data ecosystem</strong></p>\n<p>The media are a key intermediary between data producers and ordinary consumers as they can only report on data by first creating information out of it, and this was recognised in discussions during the week. Commenting on the role of the media in the NSS, Imelda Atai Musana, the Acting UBOS Executive Director said: \u201cThe media can move a conversation in any direction using our data so it is important for us to work with them to make sure they have the right data, and have understood the data the right away.\u201d The pressure of the fast pace of today\u2019s 24-hour news cycle sometimes leaves little room for nuanced and fact-based reporting \u2013 especially when the subject has to do with data. The first day of Africa Statistics Week was media training where journalists were taken through the basics of statistics reporting. The fact that very few journalists in Uganda are data-literate and data journalism has only just begun to pick up in the country makes the need for this collaboration between data producers and the media even more critical. Media managers, however, also need to invest in skills building for their reporters \u2013 not only to add value to their talent pool but also to provide the public with fact-based, high-quality reporting. These skills might include basic data scraping, data analysis and use of basic statistical software for analysis.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Technology has completely transformed the nature of traditional statistics</strong></p>\n<p>Transformative change is happening across the data ecosystem, from production, dissemination and use, to outreach and coordination. The need for national statistics offices (NSOs) and other producers and users to adapt to these changing realities in capacity building, financial investments, production and analysis of data has never been greater. UBOS is taking the lead in this area \u2013 on the third day of Africa Statistics Week, a mobile app was launched which helps users access key datasets and indicators directly on their mobile phones. Christened \u2018UGStats,\u2019 the UBOS app is a landmark effort in the bureau\u2019s effort to modernise official statistics by adopting technology to ease users\u2019 access to data. This, and other UBOS initiatives, demonstrate the bureau\u2019s endeavour to revolutionise the traditional nature of the NSO, widening the data ecosystem and improving data use. <strong>Users need to work with UBOS to improve these initiatives and contribute to the wider goal of demystifying official statistics.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>3. Geospatial data is more important than ever </strong></p>\n<p>NSOs around the world are trying to integrate geospatial data into mainstream statistics and this cannot happen fast enough. Just knowing how people are doing socially or economically isn\u2019t sufficient; we need to know who they are, where they live, and the environment they live in. Day 4 of Africa Statistics Week was dedicated to highlighting work done by UBOS\u2019 Geo Information Services (GIS) Division and other partners in the GIS world. It also happened to be World GIS Day, and a number of stakeholders discussed the importance of \u2018going beyond just mapping\u2019 to ensure geospatial data has a positive impact on the lives of ordinary people. From predicting landslides in the Eastern Uganda district of Bududa to mapping refugees in Northern Uganda and using GIS data to modernise official statistics, this debate demonstrated how technologically advanced tools are being used to collect potentially life-saving data. We shared DI\u2019s <a href=\"http://data.devinit.org/spotlight-on-uganda\" target=\"_blank\">Spotlight on Uganda</a> interactive data visualisation, in which we map poverty and related development indicators to the district level, providing decision-makers with an easy-to-use tool to access key development data.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Increased government funding of data is vital</strong></p>\n<p>Many NSOs in Africa find themselves relying on donor funding for key projects, which is the wrong formula. Governments need to prioritise financing for data, as evidence is an indispensable part of policy making. As Uganda\u2019s Prime Minister stated in his address at Africa Statistics Week: \u201cwe must continue to provide reliable data that we can confidently use to measure where we are and project where we want to go as a country. Statistics are our eyes as policy makers: they are like oil needed to run a vehicle. We cannot do without statistics in our economy\u201d<em>. </em>Just like roads, electricity and other infrastructure therefore, accessing good financing data should be among the government\u2019s top priorities.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Administrative data must be developed and improved</strong></p>\n<p>More effort is needed to develop and improve administrative data as it is cheaper than surveys and censuses. UBOS should take the lead in supporting other government ministries, departments and agencies that produce administrative data to improve standards and quality assurance. This would be the most efficient way to ensure that this data qualifies as high-quality official statistics, which can then be made available for use by researchers, policy makers, governments and other users.</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "How can data really be transformative?", "author": ["Harpinder Collacott"], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "23 Oct 2018", "description": "DI Executive Director Harpinder Collacott explores how policymakers could be more engaged with the data community and the role of the UN World Data Forum", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/can-data-really-transformative/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>The second <a href=\"https://undataforum.org/\" target=\"_blank\">UN World Data Forum</a> (WDF), which takes place between 22 and 24 October in Dubai, is one of the outcomes of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It has put the data and statistical community in the driving seat, conferring on them the responsibility to improve data quality and innovate at speed to support the implementation of the Global Goals. But for data to be transformative, the data community needs to be working with the political community so that they can put the information that is needed into the right hands at the right time and in the right way to deliver Agenda 2030 and the commitment to leave no one behind.</p>\n<p><strong>Getting policymakers to the table</strong></p>\n<p>As I participate in meetings at the second WDF, I am pleased and impressed by the dynamic and diverse people and organisations attending who are all pushing the potential of data and statistics forward. We are now at a critical point: all of this energy and all of these ideas and innovations will only have impact if we can also connect them to policy priorities.</p>\n<p>Decision-makers from the national to the subnational level are often absent from data discussions, despite it being their countries\u2019 priorities and needs that should be driving decisions about where investments are most needed to increase data. As well as being producers of data, they are also key users of the data, and their voice is crucial. If we are to realise the full potential of data to drive meaningful change, we need to link efforts to improve data production and use with policymaking priorities and frameworks to ensure the data is focused on the positive outcomes it can help bring about.</p>\n<p>Engagement with policymakers is also important because political buy-in and cross-governmental links are an integral part of bringing pilots and proof-of-concepts to scale. Such pilots can often be at the forefront of innovation but their potential to produce transformative results will only be realised if there is the political buy-in to scale them up.</p>\n<p><strong>Making the most of the data we have, but not accepting the status quo</strong></p>\n<p>We are already nearly a quarter of the way through the SDG era and the pressure is on to show results. This means we must get policymakers using the data we have \u2013 however imperfect \u2013 while also continuing to improve data quality and systems as we go, otherwise we risk running out of time. There is ample data to tell us who to focus on, where and how to do things differently but decision-makers are not accessing or using this information consistently or effectively. So it is our responsibility as the data and statistical community to communicate better with data and inspire action that will result in changes on the ground.</p>\n<p>Current data needs to do a much better job of supporting implementation as well as demonstrating results so that policymakers focus on the right areas to keep Agenda 2030 on track. At the same time, we must make sure no one becomes complacent about how little is really known about poverty and how it is being addressed \u2013 the data we have is not even close to good enough to track our aspirations to leave no one behind, and this is unacceptable. Policymakers should not feel satisfied with working on such poor information, especially when the means to improve it are so available. The data community must consistently make the case for this two-pronged approach, ensuring that policymakers make use of the data that is available to them but also recognise where this data can be improved.</p>\n<p><strong>So where should our focus be right now? </strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Make data transparent and accessible for all</strong> \u2013 access to information is critical for implementing policy and targeting resources. It enables planners and service providers, civil society actors and donors to design and deliver effective programmes, and it enables the communities they serve to hold them to account for their decisions. As global poverty falls in aggregate, so improved targeting and a focus on the local become increasingly important. Data must be translated to the local policy context and made accessible to encourage action.</li>\n<li><strong>Mobilise the power of administrative data</strong> \u2013 improving administrative data systems at country level is a difficult but essential job. Unless we count people \u2013 collect real-time data on the services that are reaching them, who is being born and where, who is dying and why \u2013 we will not be able to target the people most in need and ensure their lives are improving. Currently 55% of the poorest 20% of people in the world do not have their births registered. If you are invisible to your government, it cannot target you specifically to prevent you from being left behind. Civil registration and better administrative data systems are essential for policymakers working at the national and subnational level to plan, deliver, manage and monitor the services that are fundamental to people\u2019s lives \u2013 health, education, water, sanitation, social protection. By improving administrative systems disaggregated data will increase too and so will its coverage and frequency.</li>\n<li><strong>Improve data communication</strong> \u2013 we must put much more effort and investment into improving data communication to both ordinary people and politicians. Digital tools including social media platforms provide new opportunities for the public and politicians to communicate and exchange ideas, but we have not capitalised on them by enabling people to use data. There is untapped potential here to get people engaged with making the world better \u2013 whether that\u2019s reporting water points that need servicing, holding politicians to account, or engaging in community/civic discussions or providing feedback. The data community needs to devote as much attention (maybe more) to how data is communicated, understood and used as we do to how it is gathered. The narrative that you build on the foundation of data is what can change the world for the better.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So let\u2019s be open to doing things differently so we can make greater strides with data and transform the lives of people for the better.</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Who is being left behind? A new perspective on mul...", "author": ["Amy Dodd"], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "15 Oct 2018", "description": "DI Engagement Lead Amy Dodd outlines a new approach for getting to grips with the multidimensional nature of poverty in a real and meaningful way.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/left-behind-new-perspective-multidimensional-poverty/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>Our understanding of poverty has evolved over the years. We have tightened our grasp on its complexity and the numerous interconnected factors \u2013 big and small \u2013 that drive it. Nowhere has this been more evident than in the new development agenda agreed in 2030, with its ambitious and holistic goals which look at \u2018traditional\u2019 development challenges as well as those beyond, encompassing climate change, fragility and the societal and global enablers and disablers of development. The commitment to leave no one behind \u2013 the fundamental and important transformational shift in the SDGs \u2013 made this concrete. It has taken us years to start to get to grips with that pledge, to resolve what changes must be made to deliver it, to move beyond looking at national-level aggregates and really understand poverty from a people-centred perspective. What is more, we have still not made that shift in practice and changed the way we act, the priorities we focus on, or how we spend, target and use development finance.</p>\n<p>Time is running out. We are already three years into the SDGs, and all the evidence points in one direction: we are currently seriously off track to meet the goals, and SDG 1 and 10 on poverty and inequality in particular. Focusing on people is critical \u2013 the gap between the poorest and the rest is continuing to grow, both within countries and globally, and this fact in itself implies that new approaches are required if we are to affect change. What we have done until now has clearly failed to reach the poorest people, so business as usual is not good enough.</p>\n<p>Getting to grips with this challenge in a real and meaningful way will also mean getting to grips with the multidimensional nature of poverty. Poverty is absolutely about economic factors like income \u2013 which has a fundamental impact on what you can afford, and thus your standard of living. But it is also about the other factors that push people into and keep them in poverty, factors that are well beyond the control of any individual and impact at a much larger level \u2013 things like climate change, conflict and other drivers of fragility. Factors that affect different people differently based on their circumstances. To get the complete picture, and to ensure that we genuinely leave no one behind, we need to use an approach that considers poverty and vulnerability at the level of the country as well as the individual, and reflects the interaction between the two.</p>\n<p>When we do that \u2013 evaluating countries at risk of being left behind not only based on poverty, but also human development and fragility \u2013 we can see just how common it is for countries to exhibit vulnerability in multiple areas. In a recent report, DI took just this approach and found a list of 30 <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/countries-left-behind/\" target=\"_blank\">countries being left behind</a>; 27 of these are being left behind by two or more of the metrics above. What is more, the countries listed showed a number of common traits beyond their vulnerability: 21 are low-income countries, and 24 are in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>\n<p>And there are other similarities. These are the same countries that often struggle to attract international financing, don\u2019t receive as much ODA (directly and indirectly), don\u2019t have the same levels of <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/oda-for-domestic-revenue-mobilisation/\" target=\"_blank\">domestic public finance</a> or the capacity to raise it, and need real investments in creating an <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/enabling-environment-private-sector-development/\" target=\"_blank\">enabling environment</a> to make the most of private finance or attract businesses. These shared financing shortfalls stand in the way of poverty reduction and economic development; money alone will not solve the problem, but it will be a critical part of the solution.</p>\n<p>While the challenge of reaching the people furthest behind appears at first to be a single one, therefore, it is at the same time a compound problem that must be approached at multiple levels. The reality is that some countries are simultaneously carrying the dual burden of internal and relative inequality \u2013 these are whole countries most likely to be left behind, where the achievement of the SDGs by 2030 is highly unlikely based on our current trajectory. There is cause to be hopeful, however, if we act now \u2013 research published in our report <em><a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/investments-to-end-poverty-2018/\" target=\"_blank\">Investments to end Poverty 2018</a></em> shows how we need to change our approach to achieve that better and more optimistic future. Mobilising more and better finance targeted effectively at where it is needed most is vital to reach those people and places most a risk of being left behind but, perhaps most importantly, that will require us to mobilise political will and action.</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Is using ODA for blending a good use of scarce con...", "author": ["Cecilia Caio"], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "10 Oct 2018", "description": "Blended finance is dominating international development financing discourse.

The unprecedented ambition of the 2030 Agenda will be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve unless all actors play a part and the development impact of all resources is maximised. However, such close focus risks pushing important issues out of the spotlight, such as how traditional forms of development cooperation are being used in key social sectors \u2013 this remains crucial if we are to ensure no one is left behind.</p>\n<p>Development Initiatives\u2019 <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/investments-to-end-poverty-2018/\" target=\"_blank\">third Investments to End Poverty report</a>\u00a0sets out the financing challenge to leave no one behind. It shows clearly the continued value of ODA as a unique resource that can be directed to the poorest and most vulnerable people and countries, and to key sectors such as health, education and social protection. These are sectors that other forms of finance \u2013 including private finance mobilised via blending \u2013 tend to bypass.</p>\n<p>We have a big funding gap to fill if we\u2019re to achieve the SDGs, and we need to close it in the right way because ending poverty and ensuring sustainable development is about much more than volumes of finance. Public and private financing are not substitutes for one another. SDG 1 and SDG 10 commit us to reach the poorest first, yet <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/blended-finance-understanding-its-potential/\" target=\"_blank\">we know that private finance mobilised via blending \u2013 based on use and distribution to date \u2013 will not do this.</a></p>\n<p>Blending certainly has <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/blended-finance-understanding-its-potential/\" target=\"_blank\">a role to play in funding the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</a>, and private-sector actors, if anything, need to step up to meet these critical responsibilities. Their contributions must be increasingly leveraged, and so a focus in this area is appropriate; however, if we\u2019re serious about leaving no one behind in the run up to 2030, there must be a much more balanced debate on how we apportion scarce concessional finance resources. The way aid can be spent effectively will change in different settings and over time, and in some contexts, using it to support blended finance interventions could prove to be a \u2018good use\u2019 of ODA. For now, there is no way to say this with certainty.</p>\n<p>The OECD is leading efforts to ensure that shared values and high standards are applied throughout the financing process where blending is involved. Progress is being made on important aspects, including effectiveness and transparency. More remains to be done if we want to be sure that allocating scarce concessional resources to blended finance deals is not drawing resources away from other types of interventions that we know can be effective at meeting the needs of the poorest people.</p>\n<p>For making good decisions about using ODA in blending we need:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>More evidence on the impact of blended finance on the poorest people\u00a0</strong>including the channels through which it can impact the poorest people, the conditions that need to be in place for blending to have a positive impact on them, and how blending can be implemented alongside more systemic investments to create an <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/enabling-environment-private-sector-development/\" target=\"_blank\">enabling environment</a> for domestic private sector development to thrive</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>More evidence on how blended finance can serve nationally identified sustainable development priorities, and more broadly, national ownership\u00a0</strong>including who benefits from blended finance investments, what the effect is on domestic private-sector development, and how commercial investments mobilised via blending are contributing to domestic revenue mobilisation</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>More and better data and transparency on blended finance</strong>\u00a0including risk profiles of blended finance deals (needed to attract more investors), and also on the volumes of ODA being spent in blending, and who benefits (key for strengthening accountability on who these investments are serving)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Today and tomorrow, on the margins of the Annual Meetings, stakeholders at the <a href=\"http://www.thkforum.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Tri Hita Karana Forum</a> are discussing, among other things, the adoption of a common roadmap for turning shared values for effective blended finance into action.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-topics/OECD-Blended-Finance-Principles.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">OECD Blended Finance Principles</a>, which this roadmap draws on, cover some of the considerations raised above.

The rest of the population saw an increase of around $0.70, taking average incomes to $18.38.

The poorest people in the world, those who live at the consumption floor, had seen increases in their incomes, which rose from about $0.99 in 1999 to more than $1.04 in 2008.</p>\n<p>However, there has been a rapid decline since then with incomes dropping back to $0.99 in 2015.

This is disappointing, not least because the Committee\u2019s report represented a long and serious piece of work, drawing on a wide range of evidence and a variety of perspectives to look across the UK government\u2019s development and aid work \u2013 see our review of the report <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/significant-reforms-are-needed-for-uk-aid-spending-to-remain-transparent-and-poverty-focused/\">here</a>. It detailed critical challenges on the spending, use and management of aid, and how the government could address them.</p>\n<p>Most notably, the report told the UK government:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is a lack of a clear development focus from non-DFID government departments. While they may not necessarily be wasting aid money, <a href=\"http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/international-development-committee/definition-and-administration-of-oda/written/75678.html\">analysis</a> shows they are simply not sufficiently poverty focused. With the poorest people in the world showing worryingly slow or absent progress, it is imperative that this is taken seriously.</li>\n<li>There has not been enough progress on transparency outside DFID \u2013 something the government promised to improve dramatically in its <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-aid-tackling-global-challenges-in-the-national-interest\">2015 Aid Strategy</a>. The deadline for that was 2020 but progress to date suggests there is cause to be concerned. Transparency is an important means to an end \u2013 as an enabler of better development that can support better learning and stronger accountability.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is positive that the government has committed to take some serious steps to move forward on transparency, particularly in committing to an independent external review of progress in 2019. This has implications across government \u2013 it could enable better visibility and accountability on the level of poverty focus of government departments and facilitate joined-up working. Indeed, if transparency can drive a more coherent policy and approach across government, this could unlock some useful progress towards better synergies and effective coordination that are currently lacking.</p>\n<p>However, even if greater transparency provides more information about how UK aid is spent, the government has shown an apparent lack of concern for the data we already have on departments not focusing enough on poverty. All the recommendations from the IDC on how to improve other government departments use of aid towards poverty have essentially been rejected. For example, how DFID could play an important quality assurance role for all UK aid, suggestions to improve oversight and accountability, and measures to improve coordination across government. Safe to say, transparency will not be sufficient to ensure aid goes to those most in need.</p>\n<p>And it is not just the IDC\u2019s report that shows why this is so concerning \u2013 see for example recent reports from ICAI on the <a href=\"https://icai.independent.gov.uk/report/cssf/\">Conflict Security and Stability Fund</a> (CSSF)and the <a href=\"https://icai.independent.gov.uk/report/prosperity-fund/\">Prosperity Fund</a>, the Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy review of the <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/joint-select/national-security-strategy/news-parliament-2017/conflict-stability-security-fund-launch-17-19/\">CSSF</a> and the Foreign Office ranking very low on latest <a href=\"http://www.publishwhatyoufund.org/the-index/2018/\">Aid Transparency Index</a>.</p>\n<p>Why does this all matter so much? The UK is a key player in international development and one of the largest donors in the world \u2013 so what they do makes a difference. At a time when such an important aid donor is shying away from a focus on poverty, we desperately need them to do the opposite.</p>\n<p>The world and development are getting more complicated, not less. <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/global-humanitarian-assistance-report-2018/\">Poverty is becoming increasingly concentrated in fragile contexts</a>, whether that\u2019s fragility driven by conflict or by environmental insecurity. This makes it harder to tackle and therefore more important than ever to ensure we are smart and strategic about aid spending \u2013 we need to work smarter, longer term and much better together. These critical resources must be targeted at those who are most in need and least likely to have access to other types of resources. If the UK is serious about the promise it made when it pledged to end global poverty by 2030, then it is surely problematic to knowingly not target aid to the poorest people.</p>\n<p>Moving forward on transparency will be a significant step in the right direction, and one to welcome. But all parts of the UK government, especially when they are using scarce aid resources, have to meet high standards of effectiveness, efficiency and with a laser sharp focus on impact for the poorest people. Much more is needed to make that leap into working differently, in ways that will be more effective in achieving the promise to end poverty and leave no one behind.</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Data to leave no one behind: Development cooperati...", "author": [], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "06 Sep 2018", "description": "Swiss Special Envoy for Global Sustainable Development Michael Gerber discusses Switzerland's use of the P20 approach to characterising poverty.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/data-to-leave-no-one-behind-development-cooperation-and-the-p20/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p><strong><em>By Michael Gerber, Swiss Special Envoy for Global Sustainable Development</em></strong></p>\n<p>The shift from the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) was a watershed moment. It signalled an end to thinking dominated by old north/south, rich/poor, donor/recipient mindsets. It marked a shift from a development era to an era of universality. The <a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg1\" target=\"_blank\">SDG 1</a> and <a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg10\" target=\"_blank\">SDG 10</a> commitments \u2013 to ending poverty in all its forms everywhere and to addressing inequality \u2013 recognise the reality that the factors which cause and perpetuate poverty and exclusion exist in every society.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld\" target=\"_blank\">Agenda 2030</a> imperative to leave no one behind operates globally and nationally. Challenges including nutrition, environment and employment are shared challenges. In its call for a <a href=\"http://www.undatarevolution.org/\" target=\"_blank\">data revolution</a>, the agenda also points to the power of data to help us both meet these global challenges and monitor progress.</p>\n<p><strong>Where are we now?</strong></p>\n<p>Switzerland is generally doing well with regard to many SDG target indicators. Challenges persist, however, in being able to finance social security and health systems in view of rising costs and changing demographics, and in ensuring equal opportunities for all \u2013 independently of their ethnic background, gender, or disabilities. There may be people being left behind such as migrants who are not organised and don\u2019t have much of a lobby. Inequality is rising in some respects, and we can\u2019t be sure we are reaching the furthest behind first.</p>\n<p>There are more and profound challenges to leaving no one behind at the international level. Switzerland works with other donors, partner countries and organisations in order to live up to the pledge. We support different projects and initiatives to help ensure that no one is left behind. <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/projects/p20-initiative-data-leave-no-one-behind/\" target=\"_blank\">The P20 approach</a> is an example of this.</p>\n<p><strong>The P20, Switzerland and Benin</strong></p>\n<p>We are working with the government of Benin and Development Initiatives to identify who the poorest 20% of people, the P20, are in any community or sector so that resources and policies can be targeted and progress can be monitored towards leaving no one behind. The approach allows for a universal mindset that looks for opportunities to learn and collaborate on shared challenges across different societies \u2013 shedding light on those being left behind in Switzerland as well as Benin.</p>\n<p>The outcomes of the SDGs will be measured by data collected and analysed by national statistics offices in every country, but the data required by the leave no one behind agenda is fundamentally different in three respects:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Population data is essential. If we don\u2019t know who the population is, then we don\u2019t know who is missing. And those who are not registered are much more likely to be poorer and excluded than others \u2013 <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/p20-initiative-data-to-leave-no-one-behind/\" target=\"_blank\">55% of unregistered births are in the global P20</a>. Benin is to be congratulated on its work on civil registration and identity as a foundation for leaving no one behind.</li>\n<li>We have to have data that is disaggregated. That shows how different parts of the population are faring. Progress at the national level does not tell us about particular locations or people \u2013 and it is arguable that the extent of the gap between the P20 and everyone else is partly a result of its invisibility. Data needs to show <strong>who</strong> benefits, not just what has been achieved or a national average. People who are left behind need to be systematically included. Switzerland is working on a series of tools to make that happen in our development cooperation.</li>\n<li>And this is the most challenging: the MDGs required action to get people above a certain minimum level \u2013 specifically the international poverty line. As the data on consumption in Benin tells us \u2013 that job remains despite the progress that has been made. <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/how-the-p20-are-doing-in-benin/\" target=\"_blank\">The P20 in Benin are still living way below the international poverty line of US$1.90 a day</a>. But SDG 10 explicitly requires the poorest people to make progress at a rate faster than the national average \u2013 to narrow the gap \u2013 and in Switzerland our data tells us that is not happening. What does that mean for policy and investment? Have governments really taken on that challenge?</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Cooperation and the future</strong></p>\n<p>Both Switzerland and Benin were heavily involved in building the SDGs and the global agreement on Agenda 2030. So it is fitting that we are working on this programme together to gather and use data to monitor progress on the SDGs and to leave no one behind.</p>\n<p>Because of the different stages of development of Benin and Switzerland, we cannot expect to see the indicators showing similar levels of progress for populations. But we can expect to see governments investing similar levels of energy to delivering on their commitments.</p>\n<p>Switzerland will continue to play an important role for Agenda 2030 at the UN and in other multilateral forums. Within the framework of our long-standing bilateral cooperation with Benin, we will continue to work together in order to achieve the SDGs.</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "The P20 and progress on the commitment to leave no...", "author": ["Tony German"], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "16 Jul 2018", "description": "Tony German explains how a focus on the poorest 20%, the P20, can help ensure that development and growth are inclusive - leaving no one behind.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/the-p20-and-progress-on-the-commitment-to-leave-no-one-behind-at-country-level/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"><p>How can a focus on the poorest 20% of people \u2013 whether that\u2019s the poorest 20% in Benin, Switzerland or worldwide \u2013 help to ensure that development is inclusive?

This session will be an opportunity to share initial reflections, challenges, experiences and ideas around <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/projects/p20-initiative-data-leave-no-one-behind/\" target=\"_blank\">our P20 approach</a>.\u00a0When Benin and Switzerland signed up to Agenda 2030 almost three years ago, they signed up to a new approach that recognised shared challenges, shared responsibilities and shared opportunities.</p>\n<p>The essential focus of Sustainable Development Goals 1 and 10 is ending poverty in all its forms everywhere, reaching those people furthest behind first, and reducing inequalities within and between countries. These are universal challenges. They require complex, hard-edged and evidence-based political choices to deliver opportunity, services and quality of life for those who are left behind.</p>\n<p>By focusing attention on the poorest 20% of people, wherever they are, the P20 approach responds to this universality. And to support the complex political choices that must be made, it emphasises the use of a small number of bellwether indicators to track progress.</p>\n<p>Poor nutrition, in some places, leads to stunting and wasting, in others it leads to obesity and diabetes. It is clear that nutrition is a common challenge, even if its human cost presents in different ways. The P20 encourages countries, donor agencies, civil society organisations and companies to choose indicators in line with their own priorities; it\u2019s crucial that these be regularly monitored to deliver the kind of top-line trends that show the public and politicians what progress is being made, especially among the poorest people.</p>\n<p>While countries have widely different levels of development and prosperity, every country acknowledges poverty and inequality within its borders. The P20 approach can be applied both globally and in every country to reflect this. By focusing on the poorest 20%, we are putting a spotlight on the poorest and most vulnerable people; this includes everyone currently in, or vulnerable to, absolute poverty, plus those who by reasons of their identity (age, disability, belief, ethnicity, sexual orientation) are most vulnerable to poverty or exclusion.</p>\n<p>In every country there is unequal access in sectors including health, education and employment. Most governments accept that high levels of inequality reduce social cohesion and participation \u2013 and involve real economic cost. The P20 approach is one that can help with understanding and eradicating inequality in a variety of contexts.</p>\n<p>Two very different countries, Switzerland and Benin, are working with Development Initiatives and employing the P20 model to see if they have the data to identify the people who are left behind \u2013 and the strategies and resources that will be needed to include them in progress. We cannot expect the data on issues such as financial inclusion and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in countries as different as Benin and Switzerland to be easily comparable, but we <em>can</em> expect both countries to put comparable energy and commitment into delivering on their global and national obligations under Agenda 2030.</p>\n<p>By focusing on the poorest 20% of people, the P20 approach puts a spotlight on those people most often left behind and excluded. It provides a way to regularly measure key bellwethers of progress on how Agenda 2030 is being delivered.</p>\n<p>To find out more about how Switzerland and Benin are applying the P20 approach, join us tomorrow at the Japan Society for our <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/p20-leave-no-one-behind-country-level-high-level-political-forum-side-event/\" target=\"_blank\">HLPF side-event</a>.

Signatories should have started to publish \u201ctimely, transparent, harmonized and open high-quality data on humanitarian funding\u201d within two years of the 2016 World Humanitarian Summit. So what are the results? Well, according to our latest progress report <em><a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/grand-bargain-progress-report-1/\" target=\"_blank\">Supporting Grand Bargain signatories in meeting commitments to greater transparency</a></em>, 44 of 59 signatories are publishing open data using the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/\" target=\"_blank\">International Aid Transparency Initiative</a> (IATI)\u00a0Standard. Of these, over 80% are including some data on their humanitarian activities. This reflects a lot of hard work and energy from all those involved.</p>\n<p>However, not all Grand Bargain signatories are currently publishing detailed humanitarian data, and not all are convinced of the merits of publishing their data using the IATI Standard, which has been further developed to enable organisations to provide even more granular information on their humanitarian activities. The <a href=\"https://interagencystandingcommittee.org/grand-bargain-hosted-iasc/documents/grand-bargain-annual-independent-report-2018\" target=\"_blank\">Grand Bargain Annual Independent Report</a> also stated that \u201cthe continuing lack of clarity on the purpose of and gains to be expected from increased financial transparency and how to achieve it indicates a need for discussion across all workstreams.\u201d</p>\n<p>Does this mean that some of the Grand Bargain\u2019s 59 signatories are questioning the <em>purpose </em>of increasing the transparency of humanitarian funding? If this is the case, it fundamentally challenges the underlying premise of the Grand Bargain. The Grand Bargain is about reforming the aid system to deliver a more efficient and effective humanitarian response. It\u2019s about changing the way that the humanitarian community \u2013 including donor governments, multilateral and UN agencies, NGOs and the Red Cross Red Crescent movement \u2013 works together to respond to humanitarian crises. If some who signed up to it do not believe in the transformative change increased financial transparency can have on improving the efficiency, effectiveness and accountability of humanitarian assistance, then why have we spent the last two years trying to operationalise the Grand Bargain?</p>\n<p>Development Initiatives places financial transparency at the core of what it does in order to improve impact and build a much more sustainable, resilient and equal world, where the poorest people are less vulnerable to crisis. Timely, reliable and comparable information on how humanitarian financing is being spent can enable organisations to better coordinate and target their efforts. Greater traceability of funding can improve evidence-based analysis of the efficiency of the humanitarian response and the effectiveness of its impact. Making this information open and available to all can support efforts to strengthen the accountability of governments and aid organisations to citizens in donor constituencies and, most importantly, to those in communities affected by humanitarian crises.</p>\n<p>So, transparency isn\u2019t an end in itself, and nor is publishing to the IATI Standard \u2013 they are a means to an end. If all Grand Bargain signatories published timely, transparent, harmonised and open high-quality data on humanitarian funding to the IATI Standard in line with the commitments they made at the World Humanitarian Summit, it would allow comparable information on humanitarian funding and activities to be exchanged, connected and used by many different stakeholders much faster than ever before. It would also enable humanitarian and development resources to be viewed alongside each other to provide a clearer picture of the different financing flows being mobilised in response to crises.</p>\n<p>There are also clear links between transparency and the implementation and monitoring of other commitments in the Grand Bargain. For example, greater visibility on how funding is channelled to national and local implementing partners can enable efforts to provide \u201cmore support and funding tools to local and national responders\u201d. If organisations publish better data on who their implementing partners are, it will not only help track progress in meeting this commitment, but also make the data open and available for local and national organisations to access and use. More and better data on different financing modalities can enable the humanitarian community to monitor progress against Grand Bargain commitments in these areas and to better understand the impacts of that progress.</p>\n<p>This will be transformative!</p>\n<p>A recent workshop on greater transparency recognised that more has to be done \u2013 in particular on the need to focus on data use and user requirements as well as on the collection of good-practice examples, to showcase and learn from efforts that have led to greater efficiencies and enabled a more detailed analysis.</p>\n<p>At the same time, it also looks like Development Initatives and others who are supporting the greater transparency workstream have more to do to win over hearts and minds. The workstream can achieve success only if all the Grand Bargain\u2019s signatory organisations are fully behind the \u2018purpose\u2019 of transparency, and that this is backed up by investment and action within institutions and sustained by political support and engagement across the Grand Bargain as a whole.</p>\n<p>Organisations should be seeking gains which will go beyond them as individual publishers. The \u2018gains\u2019 of transparency should not be seeking to reward publishers for their good efforts, but to reward the people the Grand Bargain sets out to serve, and for whom the transparency agenda really needs to deliver. We are not being transparent for its own sake, but for the change it has the potential to bring about in the lives of people affected by crises around the world. It is not until their lives change for the better that success can be claimed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Increasing the use of IATI data in country systems...", "author": ["Conrad Zellmann", "Petya Kangalova"], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "18 Jun 2018", "description": "Petya Kangalova explores the use of IATI data in country aid information management systems (AIMS), with pilot projects in Senegal and Madagascar.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/increasing-use-iati-data-country-systems-reflections-senegal-madagascar/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>The use of International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) data in country systems is one of the most important frontiers when it comes to drawing value for decision-making from the significant amounts of data now available. More than 700 organisations now publish details on their contributions to sustainable development, including both development and humanitarian activities, to the IATI Standard. Integration and use of this data in country aid information management systems (AIMS) and processes is therefore a significant opportunity and priority, as reflected in <a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/governance/iati-data-use-strategy-2017-19\" target=\"_blank\">IATI\u2019s data use strategy</a> and <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/aid-data-needs-use-cases-nepal/\" target=\"_blank\">DI\u2019s own research</a>.</p>\n<p>In this context, Development Initiatives was pleased to partner with <a href=\"https://www.developmentgateway.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Development Gateway</a> to pilot an effort to support technical capacity and practical ability to use IATI data within country systems in Senegal and Madagascar. Generously supported by UNICEF and focused around import of their data during the pilot phase, this involved the placement, training and accompaniment of Aid Management Fellows in the foreign aid units of both governments. Development Gateway, with their long-standing experience in national aid management systems, were leading the overall effort, while DI contributed its technical expertise in IATI.</p>\n<p>You can read the <a href=\"https://www.developmentgateway.org/iatiaims/fullreport\" target=\"_blank\">full report</a> about the experience and lessons learned. A <a href=\"https://www.developmentgateway.org/iatiaims/summary\" target=\"_blank\">summary report</a> was also developed, which includes a series of questions and answers that development partners and government partners might ask when considering using IATI data in local AIMS. Two country-specific reports for <a href=\"https://www.developmentgateway.org/iatiaims/madagascar\" target=\"_blank\">Madagascar</a> and <a href=\"https://www.developmentgateway.org/iatiaims/senegal\" target=\"_blank\">Senegal</a> on strengthening the capacity to use IATI in AIMS were also produced. Please also have a look at <a href=\"https://www.developmentgateway.org/blog/did-we-make-publish-once-dream-reality\" target=\"_blank\">Development Gateway\u2019s blog and reflections</a> on how we have progressed in making the \u2018publish once, use often\u2019 dream a reality.</p>\n<p>As detailed in the full report, the pilot delivered important results and learnings. For example, use of IATI data in Senegal\u2019s Aid Management Platform resulted in adding data on more than US$200m in donor commitments and almost the same amount in disbursements to the data previously available to the government. In Madagascar, there was significantly more project data in the IATI file than in the country\u2019s Aid Management Platform. While of course a number of technical challenges had to be overcome in the data import in Madagascar and Senegal, both countries have started taking important steps to help donor organisations roll out IATI-based reporting.</p>\n<p>As part of the IATI Secretariat, Development Initiatives leads on the management and technical implementation of the IATI Standard. In the pilots, Development Initiatives together with Development Gateway developed an IATI-AIMS Training Guide (available in <a href=\"https://www.developmentgateway.org/iatiaims/TrainingGuideEN\" target=\"_blank\">English</a> and <a href=\"https://www.developmentgateway.org/iatiaims/TrainingGuideFR\" target=\"_blank\">French</a>) that was used to train the two IATI fellows on how to understand, review and prepare IATI data to be used by the government. So, how did the training go?</p>\n<p>There are many reflections and lessons learnt from the training phase that we can mention here, but we have decided to outline two in particular:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Language:</b> You may immediately think there is a language barrier, in terms of the different languages spoken by the trainers (English) and the Aid Management Fellows (French) as well as all most guidance on the IATI website being in English. While this is indeed a challenge for some IATI users, for this particular training it was actually not a problem as the fellows were speaking a bit of English and were working very well together. What was challenging, however, was speaking the same \u2018IATI language\u2019. There is such a diverse interpretation of what is meant by transactions, such as \u2018disbursement\u2019 or \u2018commitment\u2019 by the different users of the data (e.g. UNICEF headquarters, UNICEF country office and government staff). Before using and interpreting the data, it was really important to align the definitions so that there is common understanding and we are able to speak the same \u2018IATI language\u2019. We need to create a much simpler narrative that can be understood by all partners, and in all languages, and this pilot contributed to making the first step of the definition mapping.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Importance of partnership, feedback loops and sustaining IATI knowledge: </b>It is not easy to be trained in IATI in a week. This project required joint efforts from many partners collaborating to make it work: Development Gateway, Development Initiatives, the two Aid Management fellows, UNICEF country office staff, UNICEF headquarters staff, and local government staff in Senegal and Madagascar. Face-to-face training with the fellows in Dakar really helped, as well as their commitment and eagerness to learn. The partnerships were already built so there was no issue of trust. Everyone recognised the amount of effort invested in this project and worked really hard to make it work. So, how do we make sure that IATI knowledge is sustained in both Senegal and Madagascar and scaled up in other countries? This project showed that to do so we need to ensure that there is an improved feedback mechanism between IATI publishers (UNICEF headquarters and country office) and IATI users (government), that there is a localised support structure, that knowledge is shared widely and maintained within each organisation.Training people locally who would then be able to share and spread the knowledge more widely (as done by the fellows) is needed to sustain the IATI knowledge and improve the use of IATI data in government.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall, the \u00a0project demonstrated a practical approach to increasing the use of IATI data in country AIMS. Experience is building with comparable and different experience across other contexts, too, for example in <a href=\"https://catalpa.io/project_feature_mohinga/\" target=\"_blank\">Myanmar</a> and <a href=\"http://bd-iati.github.io/files/Using%20IATI%20data%20to%20enhance%20Bangladesh's%20AIMS%20-%20Final%20report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Bangladesh</a>. Going forward, we are keen to keep learning from these and to collaborate with national and international partners to realise the value of IATI data for decision-making in development efforts.</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Significant reforms are needed for UK aid spending...", "author": ["Amy Dodd"], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "05 Jun 2018", "description": "Today the UK Parliament\u2019s International Development Committee published a report following its inquiry into the definition and administration of ODA.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/significant-reforms-are-needed-for-uk-aid-spending-to-remain-transparent-and-poverty-focused/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>Today the UK Parliament\u2019s International Development Committee published a <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmintdev/547/54702.htm\" target=\"_blank\">report following its inquiry into the definition and administration of official development assistance (ODA)</a>. This inquiry asked a critical question \u2013 how effective are government departments, beyond DFID, at administering their <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-aid-tackling-global-challenges-in-the-national-interest\" target=\"_blank\">ever-growing proportion of the aid budget</a>? And the answer for some departments is quite damning.</p>\n<p>The report compiles evidence across the entire portfolio of UK aid. It clearly highlights that answering that question boils down to a few key factors that go back to the basics of development and good aid \u00a0\u2013 showing clearly who will benefit from interventions and how they will impact poverty. It also includes being open, transparent and accountable in what they\u2019re doing. Other parts of the UK government have much to offer in terms of contributing to the UK\u2019s development efforts but they also need to meet the high standards expected of all UK aid.</p>\n<p>And it is clear there is some work to do. While the committee rightly recognises that there may be something of a transition and learning period, it is clear that 3 years into the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-aid-tackling-global-challenges-in-the-national-interest\" target=\"_blank\">2015 UK aid strategy</a> departments beyond DFID still have some way to go. In particular, cross-government funds need to be improved and substantial reform across government is needed. The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cross-government-prosperity-fund-programme\" target=\"_blank\">Prosperity Fund</a>, for example, came in for serious critique as the Committee questioned it\u2019s focus on poverty reduction including \u2018negligible targeting towards helping the poorest and most vulnerable\u2019.\u00a0 DFID, of course, should always strive to improve, but it remains a world class development agency \u2013 respected, effective and high impact. Clearly channelling more aid to other government departments creates both challenges and opportunities. If aid\u2019s primary objective is poverty eradication, as the Committee rightly asserts, then the fact that other government departments do not do this as well as DFID is a serious concern. Tackling that problem is critical and the need for more robust checks and balances is clear \u2013 the report suggests that DFID could have a much stronger role in oversight of all ODA.</p>\n<p>There are also questions about the efficiency, effectiveness and value for money of other departments. Most obviously, progress on meeting transparency standards seems to have been lacklustre at best. The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/conflict-stability-and-security-fund-cssf\" target=\"_blank\">Conflict, Stability and Security Fund</a> was of particular concern for the Committee here \u2013 with a presumption to publish information but evidence that, in practice, information was routinely redacted. This is particularly concerning given that transparency is a necessary pre-cursor to so many elements of effective aid \u2013 to know how aid is used and its impact, and to strengthen accountability and understand where improvements can be made.</p>\n<p>The report\u2019s recommendations are practical and would go a long way to redressing some of the challenges departments beyond DFID are facing with their aid programmes. Our reflections on those we consider to be particularly interesting and important include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Strengthening the oversight and responsibility of the Secretary of State for International Development and Independent Commission for Aid Impact over all ODA spending is critical, and this will obviously require political support at the highest levels from other departments and ministers.</li>\n<li>Strengthening the requirement for all UK aid to have poverty eradication as its primary focus is key to protecting the impact and results UK aid can achieve. Turning that from words into practice will require significant changes, including to current strategies, plans and ways of working.</li>\n<li>Much more and much faster progress is needed on key enablers of good development such as transparency \u2013 all government departments and funds need clear, actionable strategies for how they are going to achieve this.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, the big question now is, how will the government respond? The report provides some useful ideas that would help to protect the effectiveness and poverty focus of UK aid \u2013 something this government has always been rightly proud of. Ensuring aid does what it is supposed to do \u2013 helping to end poverty \u2013 will also be vital for maintaining public support. The findings from this inquiry suggest that a few minor tweaks to the system will not suffice. Significant reform across government is needed to ensure that all other government departments and funds meet the high standards that DFID has set for UK aid spending.</p>\n<p>Read our <a href=\"http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/international-development-committee/definition-and-administration-of-oda/written/75678.html\" target=\"_blank\">full written submission to the inquiry</a> and <a href=\"https://parliamentlive.tv/event/index/1fe2d995-4813-433c-988c-370d51878d46\" target=\"_blank\">listen to the oral evidence session</a>.</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "The needs of Kenyans by county: exploring the late...", "author": ["Steve Kenei"], "format": "Data blog", "date": "30 May 2018", "description": "Steve Kenei explores the latest poverty data by county, and how it can be used to ensure that devolution in Kenya is delivered effectively.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/the-needs-of-kenyans-by-county-exploring-the-latest-poverty-data/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>The <a href=\"http://devolutionasals.go.ke/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Policy-on-Devolved-Government-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">devolution of powers</a> from Kenya\u2019s central government to its 47 counties has been a policy priority in the country since 2013 when the counties were established.

We have recently updated the tool with data from the 2015/2016 Kenya Integrated Household budget survey (KIHBS). Using this data on a range of indicators including poverty and food poverty headcounts, we can gain insight into the varying challenges and needs of people living in each county.</p>\n<p><strong>Where are people most affected by poverty?</strong></p>\n<p>The top-line statistic carried by the Spotlight on Kenya is <a href=\"http://data.devinit.org/spotlight-on-kenya?state=%7b%22year%22:2016,%22indicator%22:%22spotlight_on_kenya_2017.kenya_poverty_headcount%22%7d\" target=\"_blank\">poverty headcount</a>, the percentage of people in the county living in poverty (based on the national poverty line). A quick look at the statistics highlights noticeable positive changes in the counties that recorded the highest poverty headcounts during the last survey in 2005/2006. Notably, Kwale, Wajir and Narok reduced headcounts by 23.3%, 21.6% and 18.4%, respectively. However, six counties regressed (Table 1).</p>\n<h4>Table 1: Six counties with increased poverty headcounts between 2005/2006 and 2015/2016</h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Capture.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-16280 alignnone\" height=\"284\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Capture.png\" width=\"610\"/></a></p>\n<p>In 2015/2016, people in Nairobi were the least likely to be living in poverty, with the poverty headcount standing at 16.7% of the population; at the other extreme, there were eight counties where more than 60% of people were living in poverty (Figure 1).

With 17 goals, 169 targets and around 230 indicators, Agenda 2030 sets an inspiring common framework for every country and institution but, if the poorest people are not seeing improvements in their lives, we will have failed.</p>\n<p>The \u2018Leave No One Behind\u2019 commitment is about countries AND people \u2013 there are around 30 countries that are severely off track, in which almost the entire population is among the poorest 20% of the world \u2013 the \u2018P20\u2019.\u00a0 For those countries, official development assistance (ODA) is the most important external financial resource.</p>\n<p>By 2030,\u00a0extreme poverty will be increasingly concentrated in\u00a0those countries.\u00a0And those living in other countries\u00a0will remain neglected if we continue to use the national average as our standard of progress and measure of eligibility.</p>\n<p>Claiming middle-income status can be done while a country continues to have large numbers of people living in extreme poverty \u2013\u00a0 based on average GNI. Most of the people in the P20 currently live in China, India and Nigeria. Should the governments of these countries prioritise the P20? Yes of course \u2013 and there has been considerable progress. But does ODA have a part to play? Yes, if it\u2019s specifically and transparently targeted to benefit the poorest people.</p>\n<p>But the direction of travel is different. In an effort to generate more finance for development, ODA is being used to <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/enabling-environment-private-sector-development/\" target=\"_blank\">incentivise private sector investment</a>. Currently a high proportion of ODA that is invested to strengthen the enabling environment in developing countries goes to middle-income countries, and we know very little about how it is targeted and when (or in what form) benefits will be felt by the poorest parts of the population. Similarly, even less blended finance reaches low-income countries, and the estimated $400\u00a0million per year invested in aid to mobilise domestic resources follows the same pattern, so the poorest countries are losing out when ODA is used to leverage other resources.</p>\n<p>It is quite right that the development cooperation community should be mobilising and incentivising investment in ending poverty from all sources \u2013 we need to harness the 92% of international flows that are not ODA and the 99.7% of national expenditure by donors that is not ODA. But aid is not just money \u2013 it\u2019s politics. Our ministers of international development need to come off the back foot with a stronger, bolder outreach to the business community, to other government departments, to partner governments and to agencies to get people to step up to this agenda and harness their own resources.</p>\n<p>The good news is that that\u2019s what the public think aid is for \u2013 that\u2019s what our ministers should be talking to the public about. Ending poverty is good for poor people AND it\u2019s good for all of us if we want resilient and sustainable societies \u2013 business, government, all institutions need to play their part.

Women are often more vulnerable to malnutrition, particularly around pregnancy and child rearing, with a mother\u2019s nutrition having life-long consequences for newborns and infants.</p>\n<p>Our analysis includes spending directly towards nutrition (\u2018nutrition-specific\u2019) as well as projects that focus on other areas but build improving nutrition into their design, called \u2018nutrition-sensitive\u2019 spending. Both are equally important to include in understanding the UK\u2019s role in supporting efforts to tackle malnutrition because nutrition-specific spending is <a href=\"http://www.wfp.org/nutrition/underlying-causes\" target=\"_blank\">not enough on its own</a> to drive long-term meaningful change in the state of the world\u2019s nutrition.</p>\n<h4>1.

IATI has been identified as the international standard for publishing open data on humanitarian aid and FTS as the platform for reporting how humanitarian funding is allocated and used.</p>\n<p>The latest version of the IATI standard, released in February 2018, (<a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/news/iati-upgrade-to-version-2-03-goes-live\">version 2.03</a>) enables organizations to publish more granular data on their humanitarian activities, such as earmarked funding, pledges, humanitarian clusters and cash transfers, and whether funding is channelled via local and national responders. Over <a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/news/700-organisations-have-published-iati-data\">750 humanitarian and development organizations</a> currently publish their data using the IATI standard.</p>\n<p>FTS monitors the funding progress against humanitarian response plans and appeals which amounted to $25 billion in 2018 alone. Reporting to FTS is voluntary, and as a result, the service does not always have a complete picture. The majority of organizations provide funding data to FTS through manual, often ad-hoc processes. Since many organizations already publish data on development spending via IATI, use of the standard for humanitarian spending will reduce duplicate reporting and create internal efficiencies and cost savings.</p>\n<p>Current participants for the pilot include the International Rescue Committee, the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, OCHA\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.unocha.org/our-work/humanitarian-financing/country-based-pooled-funds-cbpfs\">Country-based Pooled Funds</a>, the UK Department for International Development, and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).</p>\n<p>The pilot includes the following components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Support to pilot partners to modify their existing financial and activity reporting systems (or creating new ones).</li>\n<li>Integrating the new reporting streams into FTS, and testing FTS\u2019s recently-developed IATI ingestion module.</li>\n<li>Developing technical guidelines for reporting humanitarian funding to FTS using IATI.</li>\n<li>Training and outreach events, including an IATI-FTS technical meeting with partners.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After the pilot period, we will continue to support organizations to use IATI for FTS reporting, in line with IATI\u2019s \u2018publish once, use often\u2019 approach. The long-term goal is for the majority of organizations to use IATI to report on both their development and humanitarian spending.</p>\n<p>We look forward to sharing lessons, experiences and updates in the coming months, and to connect with other organizations that might be interested in participating.

How an online identity can be used, not only to sell us products we didn\u2019t know we needed \u2013 but potentially to sway elections. The idea that if you don\u2019t pay for a product, you are the product, casts a shadow over the role of data in everyone\u2019s lives. But a different and more positive side of the data revolution is underway. And the twin issues of who owns data and what it can be used for \u2013 and the fundamental importance of identity \u2013 are absolutely central and deserve more academic attention. The idea of a data revolution that could be harnessed to deliver on the SDGs and ensure no one is left behind is a core part of Agenda 2030. At the first UN World Data Forum, held in Cape Town in January 2017, it was clear that the statistical community was moving fast to embrace new opportunities: joining up data from different sources; making new partnerships, being open to combining informal data with official statistics; using innovative methods of data collection.</p>\n<p>Governments in the shape of National Statistical Offices and line ministries plus civil society organisations (some with their own datasets and others looking for data) were also busy exploring how the data revolution could help them deliver better on their poverty-related objectives. Academics concerned with data science, mapping technology and innovative uses of data were much in demand. But otherwise, the academic community who could potentially use the outputs of the data revolution \u2013 who could provide a stronger evidence base that would help to deliver on SDG 1 and SDG 10 \u2013 as well as potentially demonstrating how aid can work \u2013 seemed rather thin on the ground. It will be interesting to see whether the academic community is more engaged at the Second World Data Forum in Dubai during October 2018. Or at the fifth Knowledge, Policy and Statistics meeting in Incheon a month later.</p>\n<p>The data revolution has sparked welcome attention to the need for disaggregated data \u2013 especially to ensure that no one is left behind \u2013 a key component of the agenda 2030 commitments agreed by leaders from every country at the UN in September 2015. Nearly 30 years on from Naila Kabeer\u2019s influential paper \u2018Monitoring Poverty as if Gender Mattered\u2019, gender identity has moved on from being a matter of checklist to a matter of reflex within the development community. Recently the issues of disability (thanks to CSOs such as ADD and Sightsavers and the efforts of the Washington Group) and age (thanks to HelpAge and the new Titchfield Group) are fast becoming identities that are increasingly taken into account in programme design. LGBT issues are also being prioritised by the more progressive donors.</p>\n<p>This represents real progress in terms of how the data revolution is helping to deliver on efforts to address multidimensional poverty and exclusion. But there is an underlying principle that \u2013 for practical and academic reasons \u2013 really needs more attention. To look at the practicalities first: we all, as individuals, have multiple identities. These may be related to ethnicity, nationality, class or caste, religious persuasion, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability status. Or any of the many identities (some transient) which help to distinguish or define us. These can appear trivial: supporting a particular sports team or type of music. But at particular points in people\u2019s lives, these identities and identifications can be enormously important to the individual \u2013 as well as shaping how the individual is perceived by the outside world. From a statistician\u2019s point of view, to count all of these identities is fiendishly difficult and often expensive. From the perspective of organisations or governments trying to address the multidimensional nature of poverty and disadvantage, all of these identities can be potentially crucial influences on how social and economic interventions may work. And there is a real problem of people with limited resources and limited attention, unwittingly setting one identity against another \u2013 because they can only afford to gather data on a limited number of disaggregations. CSOs passionately arguing for the interests of their constituency, or bureaucrats having to prioritise can so easily act in a way that seems to elevate, for example age over LGBT status or disability over ethnicity. So the point of principle that needs to be explored and understood is fairly simple \u2013 and we should have learned this as we have gradually got to grips with the issue of gender.</p>\n<p>The fundamental principle is that a person\u2019s identity should never be the cause of their immiseration or exclusion. Can the academic community through its analysis and its teaching help to build on our shared progress on gender, to sensitise people to this broader principle? If we can do this, if we can help people broaden their understanding that a single identity \u2013 be it gender or disability or age \u2013 should not result in people being disadvantaged, to a broader awareness that identity-based vulnerability or exclusion must always be looked for and guarded against, then we will help to ensure that the data revolution uses identity in a way that can help to deliver an end to poverty and greater equity in every country by 2030.</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Leveraging data to achieve universal health covera...", "author": ["Boniface Owino"], "format": "Data blog", "date": "16 May 2018", "description": "Kenya is implementing UHC to ensure a healthy population in ASAL counties.

The poorest ASAL counties can learn from Makueni County, which provides subsidised healthcare to its residents who enrol to <a href=\"https://spc.socialprotection.or.ke/images/downloads/presentations/Kivutha-Kibwana-County-Universal-Social-Protection-Coverage-for-All.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">its UHC programme (Makueni Care)</a> at an annual fee of only KSh500.</p>\n<h3>How can data improve to ensure policy ambitions on health can be met?</h3>\n<p>Data on health indicators is currently collected through periodic surveys done at intervals of up to five years and provide only averages at national and county level. Publicly available expenditure data is not disaggregated beyond department level and is often available in formats that are not machine-readable. The existence of financial and health indicators data in different databases with limited or no interoperability limit access to and use of data. Therefore, we must invest in more regular collection of data disaggregated by age, gender, disability, wealth quintiles and region (ward and village levels) to inform planning and resource allocation decisions. This includes enhancing interoperability and automating data collection to ensure timely availability and use of quality data.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\"></a></p>\n</div><div class=\"row--cards\" ng-if=\"post.notes\">\n<div class=\"col-md-12 card m-b--2\">\n<div class=\"card__content bg--light\">\n<h3 class=\"h3\">Notes</h3>\n<div> <p>[1] Equitable share is the proportion of nationally generated revenue that is shared among the 47 counties.</p>\n<p>[2] Kenyan Shilling</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Devolution is working for Kenya, but quality data ...", "author": ["Henry Odhiambo"], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "10 May 2018", "description": "This blog post accounts how devolution is working in Kenya and in what ways quality data could drive devolution promises and the Big Four agenda.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/devolution-working-kenya-quality-data-can-make-work-even-better/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>Before the dust completely settles on the just-concluded <a href=\"http://www.devolution.cog.go.ke/index.php/about-event/conference-concept-note\" target=\"_blank\">fifth annual devolution conference</a> in Kenya, I want to present a few insights from my personal observations during the event.

Perhaps this can be attributed to the recent \u2018handshake\u2019 (a declaration of political truce) between key political protagonists in the recent and fiercely contested presidential elections, President Uhuru Kenyatta and Mr Raila Odinga.</p>\n<h3><strong>Devolution is working \u2013 it\u2019s time to unlock its full potential </strong></h3>\n<p>Keynote speakers at the conference, including President Uhuru Kenyatta, Deputy President Mr William Ruto, Former Prime Minister Mr Raila Odinga and various members of the diplomatic community, observed that <em>devolution in Kenya is working</em>. This was clearly corroborated by presentations made by counties on key achievements they have made thus far, primarily in the devolved sectors such as health, early childhood education, water and sanitation, and agriculture.</p>\n<p>The conference discussions were largely dominated by how to achieve the <a href=\"http://www.president.go.ke/\" target=\"_blank\">Big Four</a> agenda, which seems to be the lever that will epitomise President Uhuru\u2019s legacy as he begins to serve his second and final term in office as the president. Under the Big Four agenda, the Jubilee administration has prioritised delivering affordable housing, rolling out universal health coverage, increasing the share of manufacturing in the economy, and improving food security. This is in conformity to the development goals captured under <a href=\"http://www.vision2030.go.ke/\" target=\"_blank\">Kenya vision 2030</a>.</p>\n<p>From the in-depth discussions and presentations made at the conference, it is apparent that policy reforms to forge closer collaboration and encourage innovation will play a fundamental role in accelerating development initiatives.</p>\n<h3><strong>Data is a key driver to achieving devolution promises and the Big Four agenda</strong></h3>\n<p>Significant policy reforms are required to realistically achieve the Big Four aspiration and fast track development achievements under the devolution system, now in its 7th year of implementation. Key among the policy reforms is prioritisation of production, sharing and use of quality data to inform the making of every decision in all sectors. This was echoed a number of times by many speakers, especially during health and agriculture sectors side meetings. Adequate resources, both financial, infrastructure and personnel, should be allocated to regular statistics collection and analysis both at national and county levels; quality data should be both timely and disaggregated to the lowest level and ensure marginalised and hard to reach areas are not left behind.</p>\n<p>Development Initiatives (DI) has closely followed discussions on achieving universal health coverage and presented data on health indicators in <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/drought/docs/BLBL_3Kenya.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">arid and semi arid lands</a> (ASALs) counties during the devolution conference. DI has also exhibited poverty data from its <a href=\"http://data.devinit.org/spotlight-on-kenya\" target=\"_blank\">Spotlight on Kenya</a>. This is in line with our work on <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/a-summary-of-kenyas-budget-201718-from-a-pro-poor-perspective/\" target=\"_blank\">pro-poor budgeting</a>.</p>\n<p>Our most recent <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/elgeyo-marakwet-county-allocating-resources-health-sector-according-health-needs/\" target=\"_blank\">sub-national analysis</a> shows that spending may not go to where it is most needed, especially to benefit the poor. This is particularly true when decision-makers lack quality data on health needs and resource requirements. Therefore, critical data gaps must be filled to effectively plan and monitor implementation of universal health coverage. Health insurance should be used in the poorest ASAL counties as a funding mechanism aimed at enhancing access to healthcare.</p>\n<p>During the devolution conference we interacted directly with stakeholders from the national level and various counties, including development partners, county assembly members, county executive committee members, counties region economic blocs (e.g. Lake Region Economic Bloc), civil society organizations, academic and research institutions and parastatals. The stakeholders had various challenges and data needs (including data analysis to inform decision-making and advocacy initiatives, timely access of quality data in open formats and the integration of various existing data sets). We presented our Spotlight on Kenya and offered future support through our forthcoming Data Support Service.</p>\n<h3><strong>What\u2019s next?</strong></h3>\n<p>The vital role of data in monitoring and evaluating development projects cannot be denied. For counties and the country at large to make significant strides towards delivering on development promises, clear baseline indicators must be available to monitor progress and inform necessary adjustments. A culture of timely data collection, sharing in open platforms and data use must be instilled in government policy makers and development partners. Citizens must also be able to access timely open data if they are to meaningfully participate in governance processes; the Spotlight on Kenya offers citizens exactly that.</p>\n<p>Government stakeholders, particularly the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics and other departments, should ideally seek to collaborate more openly with non-state stakeholders involved in data collection and analysis work. This would enhance a common understanding on critical issues to compliment and promote wider sharing and use of existing data. Finally, and critically, there is need to strengthen the legal framework on statistics at county government level. Statistics collection as per <a href=\"http://www.klrc.go.ke/index.php/constitution-of-kenya/167-schedules-schedules/fourth-schedule-distribution-of-functions-between-national-and-the-county-governments\" target=\"_blank\">the fourth schedule of the Kenya constitution</a> is a shared role between the national and county government, although counties are not permitted to undertake certain statistics functions (such as a population census). Enactment of the <a href=\"http://kenyalaw.org/kl/fileadmin/pdfdownloads/bills/2016/TheCountyStatisticsBill2016.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">County Statistics Bill</a> and Policy, for instance, should be fast-tracked to provide a clear structure.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://data.devinit.org/spotlight-on-kenya\">Access the Spotlight on Kenya</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/themes/use/\" target=\"_blank\">Read more about our work on data use</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "What do we know about the value of data?", "author": ["Bill Anderson"], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "04 May 2018", "description": "The GPSDD concludes the best way to make the case for improved investments in data is to show the value of data in improving lives.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/what-do-we-know-about-the-value-of-data/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p><a href=\"http://www.data4sdgs.org/news/what-do-we-know-about-value-data\" target=\"_blank\">In an excellent new paper</a> by Jenna Slotin, the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data (GPSDD) concludes that the best way to make the case for improved investments in data is \u201cto show the concrete impacts of data on improving people\u2019s lives, or how a failure to invest in data holds back progress.\u201d</p>\n<p>GPSDD sees this as a cornerstone of its work.

This broader pattern suggests that efforts to raise revenue domestically have not kept up with increased government spending needs.</p>\n<p>While this should ring alarm bells given the widely recognised central role DRM has to play in national development plans and the SDGs, it does focus attention on the challenges faced in building stronger and more effective tax systems. This assessment is timely, coming before the opening of the Financing for Development (FfD) Forum in New York, where numerous state and non-state actors are gathering to discuss the importance of domestic public resources for financing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.</p>\n<p>This blog assesses three of the key discussion points from the Forum\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.un.org/esa/ffd/ffdforum/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/04/2018-ECOSOC-Forum-on-FfD-Zero-Draft_Revision-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">draft outcome document</a> and <a href=\"http://www.un.org/esa/ffd/ffdforum/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/04/Draft-2018-FfD-Forum-programme.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">programme</a>, and outlines what development partners could do to strengthen nationally owned DRM systems.</p>\n<h4>1) Use technology to strike a balance between data collection and privacy</h4>\n<p>For tax policy and administration to be effective, there needs to be enough information available to make informed decisions. However, in the search for data, governments need to be mindful about the balancing act between data collection and privacy. While failing to have sufficient information on people and companies may lead to lost tax receipts, an over-eagerness to collect data can lead to a worsening social contract impacting taxpayer compliance. This has been exemplified recently in Uganda, where much <a href=\"http://thepearltimes.com/why-museveni-ordered-ura-to-leave-bank-customers-details/\" target=\"_blank\">press attention</a> has focused on the Revenue Authorities (URA\u2019s) attempt to collect information from banks about the accounts they hold, to help track high value taxpayers. While many have praised URA\u2019s intent, it has <a href=\"http://nilepost.co.ug/2018/04/14/why-would-ura-play-ponzi-scheme-with-the-ugandan-economy/\" target=\"_blank\">been seen</a> as an act of desperation to address a lack of taxpayer information, undermining the effectiveness of its tax administration.</p>\n<p>To solve issues like these, international focus has centred on the role of technology and digitalisation to bridge the data gaps, improve compliance and provide solutions to privacy concerns, and is set to be a key discussion point at the FfD Forum. Useful relevant evidence can be found in Estonia\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.chathamhouse.org/event/how-nations-can-cope-digital-transformation\" target=\"_blank\">digital transformation efforts</a> and block chain citizen identification, as well as Kenya\u2019s I-Tax and M-service platforms. While such technological advances show clear potential, they should not be seen as magic bullets, because effective regulatory frameworks (<a href=\"https://www.bookstore.imf.org/books/title/digital-revolutions-in-public-finance\" target=\"_blank\">as highlighted in Kenya</a>) and national statistical systems (to provide information in key areas like land and company registration and administrative data) are essential foundations of effective tax administration efforts. In addition, for initiatives like medium-term revenue strategies to succeed in shaping tax policy that is cognisant of distributional implications and wider development targets (e.g. poverty, health and environment), there need to be sufficiently developed national statistical systems that can support fiscal incidence analysis. For example, the <a href=\"http://blog-pfm.imf.org/pfmblog/2017/09/why-medium-term-budget-frameworks-under-perform-in-africa.html\" target=\"_blank\">implementation of medium term expenditure frameworks</a> has been less successful where insufficient data was available. Therefore, development partners\u2019 support for these wider areas outside of tax administration and policy is likely to be crucial for sustainable solutions, especially given the current gaps in funding for <a href=\"https://opendatawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/development-data-funding-2016.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">data systems</a>.</p>\n<h4>2) Make use of the potential of DRM to drive greater policy coherence</h4>\n<p>Policy coherence for sustainable development is one of the major cross-cutting themes in both the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and the SDGs. It is also one of the three key commitments of the Addis Tax Initiative (ATI), the only one that is shared by all ATI members. <a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/publication/tax-and-development-new-frontiers-research-and-action\" target=\"_blank\">Maya Forstater\u2019s policy paper on Tax and Development</a> outlines how it has the potential to be the most impactful of all ATI commitments.</p>\n<p>It is therefore surprising to only see one entry that merely acknowledges the importance of policy coherence in the outcome document draft, rather than a more detailed account of the implications and progress against this crucial cross-cutting theme. A reason for this could be the term\u2019s broad framing, lack of clarity and the absence of a formalised set of measurements, which hasn\u2019t helped keep it high on the agenda. For instance, efforts by ATI members to report progress against it have mainly focused on <a href=\"https://www.addistaxinitiative.net/documents/Addis-Tax-Initiative_Monitoring-Report_2015_EN.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">policy coherence strategies</a>, rather than tangible results. The term would therefore need a clearer understanding and definition of what implementation looks like, both from a development partner and recipient country perspective. The FfD Forum, which stresses the interconnectedness of development finance flows, provides an ideal opportunity to further discuss policy coherence. Here are two concrete approaches through which DRM can actively support a whole-of-government approach for policy coherence for sustainable development:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Integrated national financing framework (INFF)</strong> \u2013 The term INFF was first used in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda outcome document. The UN Development Programme\u2019s Asia-Pacific Development Effectiveness Facility (AP-DEF) has since <a href=\"http://www.asia-pacific.undp.org/content/dam/rbap/docs/meetTheSDGs/Achieving%20the%20Sustainable%20Development%20Goals%20in%20the%20Era%20of%20the%20AAAA%20-%20DFAs%20as%20a%20tool%20for%20Linking%20Finance%20with%20Results.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">conceptualised</a> the INFF term and supports its operationalisation across multiple countries through development finance assessments. The INFF could provide an implementation and monitoring approach to government policy coherence at the national level and is set to be discussed at a side event at FfD.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Medium-term revenue strategies \u2013</strong> Although still in the pilot phase, these have been the focus of much attention including around the upcoming FfD Forum. They\u2019re intended to develop tax policy and administration systems that are coherent with wider national development planning, including fostering economic growth and supporting social and environment goals. Their upcoming implementation may provide key evidence on how they can feed into coherent whole-of-government approaches.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Development partners\u2019 reporting to the ATI on policy coherence for sustainable development and DRM has thus far tended to focus on policy, strategies and approaches, rather than tangible results. But more concrete evidence from development partners could support developing a monitoring framework of the ATI commitment on policy coherence through assessing institutional (e.g. ministerial coordination), regulatory (e.g. strategies and policies) and reporting coherence (e.g. evidence of change/results). For example, <a href=\"http://formin.finland.fi/public/default.aspx?contentid=350113&amp;contentlan=2&amp;culture=en-US\" target=\"_blank\">Finland\u2019s Tax and Development Action programme</a> clearly states that efforts to improve developing countries\u2019 tax capacity require policy coherence that supports development and cooperation between various actors. Concrete national-level measures for ensuring policy coherence in tax aim to strengthen cooperation among various central government actors, including Finnfund, which is required to <a href=\"https://annualreport.finnfund.fi/2016/filebank/1007-Annual_Report_2016.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">report on the contribution to government revenue</a> of its private sector investments.</p>\n<h4>3) Facilitate increased South\u2013South cooperation</h4>\n<p>Recently there have been increasing calls for technical cooperation to be less focused on prescriptive \u2018one-size-fits-all\u2019 approaches and more on tailored support to countries\u2019 own strategies. For example, there have been significant challenges in integrating medium-term expenditure frameworks or the recommendations from the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) action plan into government strategies and practices. Therefore, South\u2013South peer learning can play an important role in identifying country-specific solutions to the challenges blocking stronger and more effective DRM systems. For example, <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2018/03/akitoby.htm\" target=\"_blank\">tax reform experiences from Georgia</a> could help inform change in contexts where there are high levels of corruption and tax evasion.</p>\n<p>There are different complementary avenues to strengthen South\u2013South peer learning on tax matters. High-level meetings such as the FfD Forum and the <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/platform-for-tax-collaboration\" target=\"_blank\">Platform for Collaboration on Tax</a> provide opportunities for increased South\u2013South learning in international tax issues, although they <a href=\"https://www.taxjustice.net/2018/02/21/conference-report-platform-for-collaboration-on-tax-first-global-conference-on-taxation-and-sdgs-14-16th-february-2018/\" target=\"_blank\">may not always genuinely represent southern voices.</a> Development partners, either bilaterally or through partners (e.g. the African Tax Administration Forum and Tax Inspectors Without Borders), are also providing regional learning opportunities. While the UN\u2019s Committee of Experts on International Cooperation in Tax Matters facilitates peer learning, its funding is deemed insufficient to fulfil its mandate, according to the FfD outcome document. In summary, if toolkits like TADAT (the Tax Administration Diagnostic Assessment Tool) and concepts like medium-term revenue strategies are to be effectively implemented by governments, then a tailored stepped approach based on specific country contexts, guided by increased South\u2013South peer learning, will be key. Hopefully the FfD Forum provides a platform to do this and initiatives like ATI could facilitate greater understanding of the role of South\u2013South providers in future.</p>\n<h4>What next?</h4>\n<p>Solutions to reversing the trend of stagnating DRM are multifaceted and require cooperation and coordination from a range of stakeholders, both international and national. At this juncture it is crucial that quality and sustainable DRM remains at the forefront of people\u2019s minds \u2013 and not a refocus on revenue generation at any cost. While at the heart of the issue is securing government political will, all stakeholders need to consider their own roles in achieving success.</p>\n<p>The three key ways discussed here in which development partners can support DRM in ways that foster greater collaboration \u2013 around technology and data, increased policy coherence and greater peer-to-peer learning \u2013 will be expanded on in a full report in May. If the Addis Ababa Action Agenda was the call to action and follow-ups have established the process and structures, the International Monetary Fund\u2019s findings show that now is the time to fully assess progress and refine approaches collectively if the 2030 Agenda is to be realised.</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Will blended finance lead to private sector growth...", "author": ["Cecilia Caio"], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "18 Apr 2018", "description": "Donors facing pressure to scale up blended finance investments to plug the Sustainable Development Goal funding gap for the Sustainable Development Goals.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/will-blended-finance-lead-private-sector-growth-developing-countries/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>Donors are facing increasing pressure to scale up their investments in blended finance in order to mobilise additional commercial finance to plug the funding gap for the Sustainable Development Goals. Clear prominence is being given to the topic at this year\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.un.org/esa/ffd/ffdforum/\" target=\"_blank\">UN Financing for Development Forum</a>, and it will also feature during the <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/spring/2018/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\">World Bank and IMF Spring Meetings</a> this week and next. However, there are five key elements that are at risk of being neglected in the current debate. These must be tackled if we want blended finance to be an effective addition to the development financing toolkit and to result in sustainable private sector growth in developing countries \u2013 without causing unintended diversion of scarce official development assistance (ODA) from interventions we know benefit the poorest and most vulnerable.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h4>Long-term versus short-term solutions</h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To encourage private sector contributions to sustainable development as envisaged in the <a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/index.php?page=view&amp;type=400&amp;nr=2051&amp;menu=35\" target=\"_blank\">Addis Ababa Action Agenda</a>, donors need to support initiatives that address underlying challenges to private sector development. These can range from unfavourable international trade and investment rules, to a weak judicial and regulatory environment at the domestic level, to a shortage of skilled and healthy workforce. <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/blended-finance-understanding-its-potential/\" target=\"_blank\">Available evidence</a> suggests that blending can offer a short-term fix by leveraging new partners into a new market via individual investment projects. Even then, without the right conditions, it isn\u2019t always even a short-term solution. Ensuring the private sector fulfils its potential in relation to the SDGs requires longer term change at the national (and international) level to create <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/enabling-environment-private-sector-development/\" target=\"_blank\">the enabling environment</a> within which the private sector can flourish.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<h4>Foreign vs local private sector</h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The private sector is not a homogenous entity; different types of private sector actors have different incentives and are likely to impact on poverty reduction and broader sustainable development objectives in different ways. When it comes to blending, international donors and the global and regional development finance institutions are mainly partnering with large foreign companies and investors. The risk of this is that local, job-creating private sector partners may, in many cases, end up being crowded out. For example, trade policies that enable the entry of foreign investors into the market may create additional challenges for domestic players. Donors must consider how blending can facilitate local private sector growth and development, as well as funding important projects alongside international commercial actors.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<h4>Middle income versus poorest/fragile contexts</h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Blending requires a supply of impactful and sustainable investment projects. Those that are at a \u2018tipping point\u2019 of being profitable in the long-run but that are not perceived as investable in the short run (usually due to factors such as deal size and not being part of recognised asset classes), are the projects that can create new markets and spur additional private investment down the line. However, they\u2019re hard to find \u2013 especially in the poorest and most fragile settings. They also require a thorough knowledge of the local context in order to avoid distortion of local markets, and the crowding out of additional investment. Therefore, <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/enabling-environment-private-sector-development/\" target=\"_blank\">blending may not be the short-term solution</a> which will bring new private partners into some of the poorest and most fragile countries.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>\n<h4>Development effectiveness</h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In 2016, Development Initiatives published a blog titled <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/the-busan-principles-and-blended-finance-time-to-bridge-the-divide/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Busan principles and blended finance: time to bridge the divide</em></a>. It remains important today. While calls to scale up blended finance have since intensified, the same is not true for the need to ensure that ODA used in blending adheres to the development effectiveness principles. Donors are increasingly sharing best practice on how to evaluate the development impact of blended finance projects but too little emphasis is placed on the need to ensure country ownership, transparency and accountability, a focus on results, and inclusive partnerships in blending.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>\n<h4>Policy coherence</h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The world has changed and we cannot look at scaling up blending without also considering global trade regulations, international tax rules and financial markets. All these areas are connected and cannot be approached in isolation from the others. The aim must surely be to encourage the development of private sector at the domestic level and open up new financial flows to some of the poorest countries in the world. Blending alone cannot achieve this but used within <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/enabling-environment-private-sector-development/\" target=\"_blank\">a coherent approach to local private sector development</a>, we could see a transformation in the impact of international public finance on this area.</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Aid data use at country level: The example of Nepa...", "author": ["Conrad Zellmann"], "format": "Data blog", "date": "11 Apr 2018", "description": "There are increasing efforts to improve how aid data is shared in Nepal. The AMP reflects a growing demand for improved transparency.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/aid-data-use-country-level-example-nepal/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>In recent years there have been increasing efforts, both locally in Nepal and internationally, to improve the availability of data on international aid. The Government of Nepal has made important efforts to establish the <a href=\"http://amis.mof.gov.np/portal/\" target=\"_blank\">Aid Management Platform</a> (AMP), including its public website. Various other actors have developed platforms and initiatives to provide access to specific aid-related and humanitarian information, especially following the 2015 earthquake in Nepal. Internationally, the growth of the <a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/\" target=\"_blank\">International Aid Transparency Initiative</a> (IATI) has drastically increased availability of open aid data to more than 600 bilateral, multilateral, non-government and private sector development partners. In the context of the Data Revolution for Sustainable Development, it is critical that this data supports decision-making and accountability.</p>\n<p>As part of our DFID-supported work under the Data for Development in Nepal programme with the <a href=\"https://asiafoundation.org/where-we-work/nepal/\" target=\"_blank\">Asia Foundation</a> on the supply, sharing and use of open development data, we wanted to explore how aid data is currently used in Nepal. We were also interested to see how our findings could complement current efforts by the government to re-design the national aid management platform.</p>\n<p>Our research explored the concerns that drive the aid information needs of selected government, donor and civil society organisation actors, how they currently access the information they need, and how data sharing and user support could be structured to better meet their needs. In doing so we built on, and hope that we\u2019ve added to, the work of others\u2019 in this area, such as earlier studies on <a href=\"https://www.developmentgateway.org/assets/post-resources/understanding_government_data_use_in_nepal_final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">government</a> and <a href=\"http://www.opendataresearch.org/dl/symposium2015/odrs2015-paper33.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">donor</a> data use in Nepal, and USAID\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.usaid.gov/transparency/country-pilot-assessment\" target=\"_blank\">aid transparency pilot assessments</a> in other country contexts.</p>\n<p>So, what did we learn?</p>\n<h3>Information preferences</h3>\n<p>While we found clear interest in better aid information, there was little evidence for regular use of existing data platforms. Despite the reasonable accessibility of aid data through Nepal\u2019s AMP, the primary use of its data appears to be for the government\u2019s (fairly comprehensive) annual Development Cooperation Report. Actors outside of government in particular reported strong reliance on interpersonal networks to get access to the aid-related information they needed.</p>\n<h3>Changing information needs</h3>\n<p>In the context of Nepal\u2019s federalisation process and the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) framework in national planning and accountability frameworks, stakeholders articulated strong interest in evidence that connected aid flow data with activities and results at local levels and to the SDGs. In particular, a clear need for actionable analysis (rather than just data access) was articulated.</p>\n<h3>The importance of openness and interoperability</h3>\n<p>Not surprisingly, most of the people we spoke to are using, or require, information on aid flows in conjunction with other types of information. This includes official socio-economic statistics and other financial data. Also of importance is data taken from internal and external administrative records, for example from monitoring and evaluation reports. To be useful in producing relevant analysis, it is therefore critical that aid data can be joined up with data from other sources. This highlights the importance of openness and interoperability.</p>\n<h3>IATI as a data source</h3>\n<p>Although significant amounts of aid data, including on Nepal, are now published to the IATI standard, IATI itself is largely unknown and therefore the data is underused by those we interviewed. This is despite the fact that it could help illuminate key aspects that users say they are especially interested in, such as forward-looking information on aid allocations and data on funding by donors who do not have a local presence. Stakeholders could therefore benefit from IATI data, but are not yet sufficiently aware and familiar with it to realise this potential.</p>\n<p>Our overall analysis of these findings is that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Available aid information platforms and tools can be improved to better address key shared needs. This could be done for example by including visualisations on key aspects such as aid by SDGs and geographic allocations; trialling IATI integration (as already planned in the AMP redesign); as well as ensuring and further increasing openness of aid and other data.</li>\n<li>However, beyond these and other technical measures, proactive outreach by aid data providers to different user groups is important to ensure that key data sources are known and used. Ideally, efforts such as Nepal\u2019s AMP redesign would be accompanied by a deliberate and inclusive data use strategy. This would provide for targeted promotion, and regular interaction and learning between information users, data providers and intermediaries.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For national and international aid information initiatives like IATI, realising the value of data requires robust, open data systems and a vibrant user community. The systems and tools developed over the last few years are now delivering significant amounts of financial data on aid. Web platforms, preset reports and visualisations can address a number of shared, topline information needs. However, to meet the specific analytical needs of diverse stakeholders from planning allocations to monitoring impact, better connections between data providers, users and intermediaries are needed. A good starting point for developing these connections would be existing communities of interest and communication, such as aid coordination fora and sector meetings. Such communities could regularly bring together different user groups, development researchers, and open data enthusiasts to articulate specific needs and match them with analytical and data expertise. Open data as a technology is a key enabler for this, but increased uptake of data will happen through people-to-people exchange.</p>\n<p>IATI\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/news/iatis-new-data-use-strategy\" target=\"_blank\">Data Use strategy</a> provides a timely opportunity for the community to step up its efforts in this regard.

As such, new ways of working are needed to meet the ambitions set by the Global Goals and various summits of 2015 and 2016. Policies and financing models of the past 50 years will not get us the success we want and need. We need to work differently, and we need to start now if we are to meet the goals the world has set for 2030. Here\u2019s our data story.</p>\n<h3>We need to go beyond growth as a panacea for poverty reduction</h3>\n<p>As we all know, tremendous progress was made between 2000 and 2015 under the MDGs era in reducing global poverty. This, however, has been largely attributed to growth, and as such progress was patchy and concentrated in Asia and Latin America. According to poverty data from the World Bank, the current global poverty picture shows there are around 769 million people living in extreme poverty and more than half of them are in sub-Saharan Africa (Figure\u00a01).</p>\n<h4>Figure 1: Just over half of people living in extreme poverty are in Sub-Saharan Africa</h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Figure-1-poverty-and-financing.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-15851 size-full\" height=\"943\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1711px) 100vw, 1711px\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Figure-1-poverty-and-financing.jpg\" srcset=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Figure-1-poverty-and-financing.jpg 1711w, http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Figure-1-poverty-and-financing-768x423.jpg 768w\" width=\"1711\"/></a></p>\n<p><em>Source: Development Initiatives based on PovcalNet (2017)</em></p>\n<p>If current patterns of growth continue, in 2030 we can expect to see around 489 million people globally living in extreme poverty, 85% (418 million) of which will be in sub-Saharan Africa. We will have failed to achieve SDG 1.</p>\n<p>Looking at more optimistic growth projections we can still expect to see around 400 million people living in extreme poverty (86% in sub-Saharan Africa). Pessimistic growth projections (if growth slowed by 2%) paint a pretty stark picture, with nearly 600 million people living in extreme poverty (83% in sub-Saharan Africa).</p>\n<p>The message is clear: growth alone will not end extreme poverty, and unless action is taken people will be left behind.</p>\n<p>Looking at the country level, projections show that poverty and vulnerability will increasingly be concentrated in some of the world\u2019s most fragile places. These are often the most hard-to-reach countries and are at risk of being left behind from global progress. There are 30 identified high-risk countries, which have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>High levels of poverty</li>\n<li>Low levels of human development</li>\n<li>High vulnerability to environmental and political crises, as well as weak governance systems that limit their capacity to respond and manage crises.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The majority of these countries are, again, in sub-Saharan Africa. Figures 2 to 4 illustrate a few of many ways that these groups of countries could be identified; the lists should be taken as suggestive, rather than definitive, of countries facing some major challenges.</p>\n<h4>Figure 2: Countries being left behind according to major poverty forecasts</h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Figure-2-poverty-and-financing.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-15852 size-full\" height=\"603\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1224px) 100vw, 1224px\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Figure-2-poverty-and-financing.png\" srcset=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Figure-2-poverty-and-financing.png 1224w, http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Figure-2-poverty-and-financing-768x378.png 768w\" width=\"1224\"/></a></p>\n<p><em>Source: Development Initiatives\u2019 calculations based on World Bank PovcalNet (2017), World Bank World Development Indicators (2017), IMF World Economic Outlook (2017), World Poverty Clock (2017), Lea and Dercon (2017), and Chandy (2017)</em></p>\n<h4>Figure 3: Countries being left behind according to major human development indicators</h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Figure-3-poverty-and-financing.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-15853 size-full\" height=\"579\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1165px) 100vw, 1165px\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Figure-3-poverty-and-financing.png\" srcset=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Figure-3-poverty-and-financing.png 1165w, http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Figure-3-poverty-and-financing-768x382.png 768w\" width=\"1165\"/></a></p>\n<p><em>Source: Development Initiatives\u2019 calculations based on Human Development Index (2017) and UNCTAD (2016)</em></p>\n<h4>Figure 4: Countries being left behind according to major climate and fragility indicators</h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Figure-4-poverty-and-financing.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-15854 size-full\" height=\"601\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1181px) 100vw, 1181px\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Figure-4-poverty-and-financing.png\" srcset=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Figure-4-poverty-and-financing.png 1181w, http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Figure-4-poverty-and-financing-768x391.png 768w\" width=\"1181\"/></a></p>\n<p><em>Source: Development Initiatives\u2019 calculations based on INFORM (2017), OECD States of Fragility (2016) and ND-GAIN (2017)</em></p>\n<p>Countries most at risk of being left behind are \u2013 hardly surprisingly \u2013 those that struggle the most to mobilise resources for poverty eradication both domestically and internationally.

International support was identified as key to promote increased domestic revenue mobilisation (DRM) in efficient, effective and equitable ways. The <a href=\"https://www.addistaxinitiative.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Addis Tax Initiative (ATI)</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/platform-for-tax-collaboration\" target=\"_blank\">Platform for Collaboration on Tax (PCT)</a> were created, leading efforts to guide international support. ATI calls for the doubling of international technical support by development partner members by 2020 and increased policy coherence by all members. The PCT aims to create better cooperation on tax issues between the OECD, International Monetary Fund, UN and World Bank, and is holding its <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/events/2017/06/06/first-global-conference-of-the-platform-for-collaboration-on-tax#1\" target=\"_blank\">first conference</a> this week.</p>\n<p>It is an opportune moment to raise some key questions around progress on official development assistance (ODA, or aid) for DRM, both in monetary terms and international efforts to guide coherence. Top-level findings of our emerging work are covered here, and explored in depth in our forthcoming report (publication April 2018).</p>\n<h3><strong>Is ODA for DRM on track to meet ATI commitments?</strong></h3>\n<p>In 2016, total ODA for DRM disbursements was US$366 million, a significant increase in real terms from US$176\u00a0million the previous year. The year also saw an increase in all other related sectors, except trade facilitation (Figure 1) (unlike in 2015 when ODA for DRM appeared to \u2018crowd out\u2019 support to other areas<a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\">[1]</a>).</p>\n<h5>Figure 1: ODA to DRM and related sectors</h5>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ODA-for-DRM-Figure-1.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15787\" height=\"521\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ODA-for-DRM-Figure-1.png\" width=\"689\"/></a></p>\n<p><em>Source: Development Initiatives based on OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) Creditor reporting System (CRS)</em></p>\n<p>Nominal disbursements in 2016 from development partner <a href=\"https://www.addistaxinitiative.net/#slider-4\" target=\"_blank\">members of the ATI</a> were US$333\u00a0million, meaning the committed financing target of US$447\u00a0million is half way to being achieved with four years still remaining. However, only a few ATI development partner members drove this increase, in particular France\u2019s US$110 million ODA loan to Indonesia. In contrast, 10 ATI development partner members reduced ODA to DRM support in real terms in 2016. For example, the UK, having exceeded the ATI commitment in 2015,<a href=\"#_edn2\" name=\"_ednref2\">[2]</a> reduced support by US$7\u00a0million (17%) to US$34 million in 2016. Furthermore, receipt of ODA for DRM is concentrated, with nearly half going to Indonesia (31%), Armenia (12%) and Chad (6%) in 2016.</p>\n<h3>Is this the only financing going to DRM?</h3>\n<p>The data in Figure 1 is based solely on disbursements listed under the newly created OECD purpose code \u201815114 \u2013 Domestic Revenue Mobilisation\u2019, used by ATI to monitor support. There is, however, evidence to suggest that projects outside of this purpose code may have a major or minor DRM component. Using our <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/aiding-domestic-revenue-mobilisation/\" target=\"_blank\">ODA for DRM tracking methodology</a>, we find that there are significant amounts of financing going to such projects, not coded using the DRM purpose code (Figure 2).</p>\n<h5>Figure 2: Financing coded using OECD purpose code for DRM and others</h5>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ODA-for-DRM-Figure-2.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15788\" height=\"545\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ODA-for-DRM-Figure-2.png\" width=\"623\"/></a></p>\n<p><em>Source: Development Initiatives based on OECD DAC CRS</em></p>\n<p><em>Notes: All figures in US$ millions (constant 2015 prices).</em></p>\n<p>More funding to DRM could be captured by separating components of a project into different purpose codes (one of which being the DRM code), a methodology established by the International Aid Transparency Initiative and demonstrated by the World Bank International Development Association in their reporting to the OECD. Furthermore, purpose codes that are highly relevant to the success of DRM (shown in Figure 2) are not currently being monitored; it may be in the interest of the ATI Secretariat and useful for development partners and recipient governments to expand their financial tracking efforts to capture wider relevant purpose codes. There is also a need to understand wider ATI recipient government support to other countries (e.g. south\u2212south cooperation) as well as from ATI supporting organisations, something that could potentially be added onto the secretariats <a href=\"https://drm.taxcompact.net/\" target=\"_blank\">DRM database</a>.</p>\n<h3><strong>The numbers look good, but is ODA to DRM responding to nationally identified needs?</strong></h3>\n<p>The financing commitment under ATI looks likely to be met, but we can still question whether it is sufficient and targeted in the right ways. The answer is complex (and will be covered in our forthcoming report), but in essence we think there could be merit in focusing attention on the needs of the <em>demand</em> side, rather than the supply-side approach of \u2018doubling support\u2019. Increasingly recipient countries outline financial support required in their strategic plans (e.g. either specific revenue authorities or wider whole-of-government approaches), so could financing from development partners be identified from the ground up? For example, the Uganda Revenue Authority reported a US$31 million funding gap in 2016/17, with external development financing making up only US$0.5 million of the authorities\u2019 US$78 million budget. While the funding gap of the revenue authority and other relevant ministries or agencies can be met by other forms of financing, more understanding of the financing needs of recipient countries is required to ascertain whether a doubling of ODA for DRM by 2020 is sufficient.</p>\n<h3><strong>Is there progress in policy coherence?</strong></h3>\n<p>With the ATI commitment to double ODA for DRM seemingly on track, it gives us space to focus on improving policy coherence. Last year the ATI published its first monitoring report, which identified how development partners ensure both organisational coherence (e.g. involving their own revenue bodies in activities) and policy coherence (e.g. aligning their strategies with international taxation to in-country support, or appreciating the role of trade policy on recipient countries\u2019 revenue generation). The report found that efforts so far have narrowly focused on specific tax administration and revenue mobilisation activities, as outlined within SDG 17; there is scope for aid strategies to emphasise how their ODA for DRM can support progress against the broader SDGs. For example, the choice of a country\u2019s fiscal policy and tax regime influences the potential for redistribution to the poorest and is not gender neutral; revenue from well-designed \u2018sin\u2019 taxes, targeting unhealthy behaviour like smoking, could finance a country\u2019s public health expenditure; green taxes may incentivise developing low-carbon economic activities. To date, most development partners\u2019 strategic approaches towards strengthening tax systems in partner countries don\u2019t explicitly target this potential. DFID\u2019s 2017 Economic Development Strategy, for example, clearly emphasises poverty reduction, but its DRM component focuses on \u2018supporting countries to increase revenue\u2019, without integrating it into a wider approach of poverty alleviation and job creation. Similarly, Canada\u2019s Feminist International Assistance Policy doesn\u2019t address how partner countries\u2019 tax regimes can be inequitable in respect to gender.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/platform-for-tax-collaboration\" target=\"_blank\">First Global Conference of the Platform for Collaboration on Tax</a> provides a unique opportunity to discuss how support for DRM can be made more coherent in support of the wider 2030 Development Agenda. We look forward to stakeholders\u2019 deliberations in this area.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\"></a></p>\n</div><div class=\"row--cards\" ng-if=\"post.notes\">\n<div class=\"col-md-12 card m-b--2\">\n<div class=\"card__content bg--light\">\n<h3 class=\"h3\">Notes</h3>\n<div> <p><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a> See Oxfam America report <a href=\"https://www.oxfamamerica.org/static/media/files/State_of_DRM_2017.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.oxfamamerica.org/static/media/files/State_of_DRM_2017.pdf</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref2\" name=\"_edn2\" target=\"_blank\">[2]</a> The UK set the baseline at US$20million, based on 2014 estimates, which was doubled in 2014.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Improving data use to boost budget advocacy in Uga...", "author": ["Bernard Sabiti"], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "01 Feb 2018", "description": "Development Initiatives teamed up with the Civil Society Budget Advocacy Group to train the the Ugandan budget advocacy community on open and quality data.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/improving-data-use-boost-budget-advocacy-uganda/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>There\u2019s a vibrant budget advocacy community in Uganda made up of a wide range of actors from academics to bold and adversarial civil society groups. These include the <a href=\"http://ngoforum.or.ug/black-monday/\" target=\"_blank\">Black Monday Movement</a>, and others who undertake advocacy efforts centred on <a href=\"https://www.udn.or.ug/\" target=\"_blank\">debt</a>, <a href=\"http://accu.or.ug/\" target=\"_blank\">corruption</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.nape.or.ug/\" target=\"_blank\">environment</a>.</p>\n<p>But the quality and success of this community is often adversely affected by the lack of a strong evidence base rooted in data and analysis. Key reasons for this are 1) barriers to accessing data about public spending, 2) poor data quality such that it does not provide a clear or reliable picture, and 3) limited understanding of the benefits of using data and evidence by those doing advocacy work.</p>\n<p>DI has been working with the <a href=\"http://csbag.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Civil Society Budget Advocacy Group</a> (CSBAG) to overcome these challenges and help improve the use of data in advocacy. We\u2019ve been <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/pro-poor-orientation-of-the-201718-uganda-budget/\" target=\"_blank\">conducting analyses</a> of Uganda\u2019s national budget for several years. So we teamed up with CSBAG in December 2017 to train grass-root budget advocates in basic budget data literacy and budget policy process. This aimed to strengthen their engagement with policymakers at national and local levels on budget matters. It matters because data-literate budget advocates are far better equipped to ensure their efforts are rooted in sound evidence.</p>\n<p>Our training focused on how to source and use data, highlighting how tools such as DI\u2019s <a href=\"http://data.devinit.org/spotlight-on-uganda\" target=\"_blank\">Spotlight on Uganda</a> can be used to support the budget advocacy work CSBAG and its members do. In doing so, we equipped CSBAG\u2019s staff and members operating at national and subnational levels with more knowledge of key budget data, and demonstrated how such data can be used to support policy analysis and advocacy. We emphasised how the digital age provides us with new ways of engaging policymakers such as harnessing technology to access the evidence that underpins our advocacy efforts.</p>\n<p>35 budget advocates from 10 districts representing different regions of Uganda came along to the 2-day training. Most operate at subnational level, but a handful are also active at national level. We tackled the basics of advocacy from inception to engagement; budget processes and the roles of different players in them; and related national and subnational resource allocation frameworks. We emphasised how to increase the use of evidence and data for more robust and successful budget advocacy. On this front we explored a variety of themes, including key sources for budget and budget-relevant data in Uganda, basics of data analysis, extracting advocacy messages from data, and making evidenced-based pitches to duty bearers.</p>\n<p>The training raised important questions from participants, such as how to tell the authenticity of data sources; how to interrogate government use of \u2018cherry-picked\u2019 data and analysis; how to tell what the real story is given the sometimes multiple, conflicting sources; and how to make sure data is timely and relevant given that budget processes and data production processes do not always go together in timing.</p>\n<p>These and other questions reinforced the need for DI and CSBAG to keep in constant touch with subnational budget advocates, and establish beneficial links between national and local level resource allocation stakeholders. The training further raised the need for regular updates of our data and analysis to meet the needs of budget advocacy stakeholders.

This is to understand whether resources are allocated according to need, but also where data must improve to draw such conclusions. We focus on this county as it is about to embark on developing its second 5-year <a href=\"http://www.parliament.go.ke/statutory-documents/item/download/8_b36cddd82910134aa5a8edb0796fb5ed\" target=\"_blank\">County Integrated Development Plan (CIDP)</a>.</p>\n<h3>What does the data tell us about health needs in Elgeyo Marakwet County?</h3>\n<p>According to the Socio-Economic Atlas of Kenya 2014, Elgeyo Marakwet County has a population of 369,998 people with 2.8% of the population living with disability. Over half of people (<a href=\"http://data.devinit.org/kenya/elgeyo-marakwet\" target=\"_blank\">52.7%</a>) are living in poverty. Elgeyo Marakwet County has 54 nurses per 100,000 people and 5 doctors per <a href=\"https://www.healthpolicyproject.com/pubs/291/Elgeyo-Marakwet%20County-FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">100,000 people</a>. On maternal health<a href=\"http://data.devinit.org/kenya/elgeyo-marakwet\" target=\"_blank\">, 43.6%</a> of married women (15\u201349 years) use modern contraceptive methods and so interventions are needed to ensure improved use of such in the county. Skilled personnel attend 65% of births, which is above the national average of 57.8%. However, maternal health needs are not yet being met in the county since every birth should be attended by skilled personnel.</p>\n<p>Looking briefly at immunisation and infections, the proportion of one-year-old children immunised against measles (86.6%) in the county is slightly above the national average of 86.3%. Nonetheless, there are regional variations in immunisation coverage with regions such as <a href=\"http://www.kpda.or.ke/documents/CIDP/Elgeyo%20Marakwet.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Kerio Valley being left behind</a>. Respiratory infections, pneumonia, skin infections, diarrhoea and intestinal worms account for over <a href=\"http://www.elgeyomarakwet.go.ke/Publications/2015_16_Program_Based_Budget_Approved_by_County_Assembly.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">75%</a> of diseases reported by outpatients in the county. This underscores the need for improved provision of preventive and promotive health services since these diseases are controllable. Finally, there are nutritional needs with approximately <a href=\"http://www.elgeyomarakwet.go.ke/Publications/2015_16_Program_Based_Budget_Approved_by_County_Assembly.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">45%</a> of women of reproductive age suffering from anaemia and vitamin A deficiency affecting over <a href=\"http://www.elgeyomarakwet.go.ke/Publications/2015_16_Program_Based_Budget_Approved_by_County_Assembly.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">30%</a> of under-five-year-old children.</p>\n<h3>What does data tell us about health spending in relation to the county\u2019s health needs?</h3>\n<p>Expenditure data for 2015/16 and 2016/17 indicate that health is the priority sector in terms of budgetary allocation in Elgeyo Marakwet County. The sector accounted for 35% of the county\u2019s spending in these two financial years (Figures 1 and 2).</p>\n<h5>Figure 1:\u00a0Elgeyo Marakwet County\u2019s expenditure for 2016/17</h5>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Figure-1-Elgeyo-Marakwet-Countys-expenditure-for-2016-17.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15556\" height=\"475\" sizes=\"(max-width: 946px) 100vw, 946px\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Figure-1-Elgeyo-Marakwet-Countys-expenditure-for-2016-17.png\" srcset=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Figure-1-Elgeyo-Marakwet-Countys-expenditure-for-2016-17.png 946w, http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Figure-1-Elgeyo-Marakwet-Countys-expenditure-for-2016-17-768x386.png 768w\" width=\"946\"/></a></p>\n<p><em>Source: DI, based on Elgeyo Marakwet County\u2019s budget for 2016/17</em></p>\n<h5>Figure 2: Elgeyo Marakwet County\u2019s expenditure for 2015/16</h5>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Figure-2-Elgeyo-Marakwet-Countys-expenditure-for-2015-16.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15557\" height=\"490\" sizes=\"(max-width: 953px) 100vw, 953px\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Figure-2-Elgeyo-Marakwet-Countys-expenditure-for-2015-16.jpg\" srcset=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Figure-2-Elgeyo-Marakwet-Countys-expenditure-for-2015-16.jpg 953w, http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Figure-2-Elgeyo-Marakwet-Countys-expenditure-for-2015-16-768x395.jpg 768w\" width=\"953\"/></a></p>\n<p><em>Source: DI, based on Elgeyo Marakwet County\u2019s budget for 2015/16</em></p>\n<p>A closer look at the expenditure data reveals that planning and administrative services accounted for 76.4% (Ksh 986.4 million) and 81.8% (Ksh 1,120.6 million) of the health sector budget in 2015/16 and 2016/17 respectively. This is made up of health administration (staff-related costs), health monitoring and information management, and health sector support costs. Salaries and wages accounted for over 70% of the health budget in 2015/16 and 2016/17. The backdrop of this is perhaps the county\u2019s commitment to improve the quality and quantity of human resources in the health sector.</p>\n<p>Preventive and promotive health expenditure reduced by 6.5% from Ksh 54.2 million in 2015/16 to Ksh 50.7 million in 2016/17. Meanwhile spending on health infrastructure development reduced by 47.8% from Ksh 166 million in 2015/16 to Ksh 86.7 million in 2016/17. By contrast, expenditure on curative and rehabilitative services increased by 33.3% from Ksh 84.5 million in 2015/16 to Ksh 112.6 million in 2016/17. The decrease in preventive and promotive health expenditure and increase in curative and rehabilitative health expenditure demonstrate a clear shift in resource allocation that decision-makers must ensure drives the best health outcomes for people. Overall, the share of recurrent expenditure in the health budget declined from 87.9% in 2015/16 to 80.8% in 2016/17, but remains above the <a href=\"http://www.treasury.go.ke/tax/acts.html?download=603:the-public-finance-management-act-2012-1-1\" target=\"_blank\">recommended limit of 70%. </a></p>\n<h3>The critical role of data in ensuring needs are met</h3>\n<p>Enhancing health outcomes requires better targeting of resources, which can be achieved if access to quality data on spending on specific health services such as immunisation and malaria prevention, as well as health indicators, is improved. Such data will facilitate analysis and identification of services that should be prioritised in budgetary allocation. Thus, county decision-makers should invest in <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/citizen-generated-data-and-sustainable-development-evidence-from-case-studies-in-kenya-and-uganda/\" target=\"_blank\">regular collection and use of quality data</a> to ensure needs are met through effective resource allocation.</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Exploring inequalities in the health sector in Ken...", "author": ["Boniface Owino"], "format": "Data blog", "date": "14 Dec 2017", "description": "Not everyone in Kenya has access to the same healthcare opportunities.

There are considerable differences in distribution of health outcomes, health determinants and resources across counties in Kenya. Health inequalities have significant <a href=\"http://www.combatpoverty.ie/publications/TacklingHealthInequalities-AnAllIrelandApproachToSocialDeterminants_2008.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">social and economic costs</a> to the extent that they limit people\u2019s ability to realise their full potential in terms of participating effectively in community, social, economic and political life. So health inequalities have to be eliminated. But first budget holders and decision-makers at national and county level need access to quality data to better understand the causes of the inequalities, who\u2019s left behind and the resources needed to ensure equality and equity. Citizens and civil society organisations (CSOs) also need quality data to hold the government to account to make sure the desired health outcomes are achieved.</p>\n<p>Using our data visualisation platform, <a href=\"http://data.devinit.org/spotlight-on-kenya\" target=\"_blank\">Spotlight on Kenya</a>, we analyse county performance in three health indicators: one-year old children immunised against measles, skilled birth attendance, and use of modern contraceptives by married women.</p>\n<p>We find that the proportion of one-year old children immunised against measles is less than 75% in six counties, as illustrated in Figure 1. Coverage is relatively low in the northern part of the country too. All counties are expected to achieve and maintain as a minimum, <a href=\"http://guidelines.health.go.ke:8000/media/Immunization_Policy_Guidline.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">immunisation coverage of 80%</a>. But using the Spotlight on Kenya\u2019s top and bottom 10 tables, we find that eight counties have not achieved this target. These are West Pokot, Mandera, Wajir, Samburu, Turkana, Narok, Marsabit and Tana River. West Pokot has the lowest coverage at 58% compared with Kirinyaga which has achieved the highest at 100%. So the eight counties left behind need greater support to achieve the desired minimum coverage.</p>\n<h5>Figure 1: Proportion of one-year old children immunised against measles</h5>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Kenya-blog-screengrab-1.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15388\" height=\"311\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Kenya-blog-screengrab-1.png\" width=\"588\"/></a></p>\n<p><em>Source: DI, based on Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS) 2014 data</em></p>\n<p>The proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel is less than 30% in five counties, namely Samburu, West Pokot, Marsabit, Wajir and Turkana. By contrast, over 85% of births in the top five counties \u2013 Kiambu, Kirinyaga, Nairobi, Nyeri and Muranga \u2013 are attended by skilled health personnel. Again a clear geographical pattern emerges here given that all the bottom five counties are located towards the northern part of the country, whereas all the top five are in the central region. What is more, the proportion of people in poverty is over 70% in all the bottom five counties except West Pokot (at 66%). By contrast, the proportion of people in poverty is less than 30% in the leading counties, except in Muranga (at 33%).</p>\n<h5>Figure 2: Proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel</h5>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Kenya-Spotlight-blog-births-attended-by-skilled-health-personnel.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15389\" height=\"306\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Kenya-Spotlight-blog-births-attended-by-skilled-health-personnel.png\" width=\"584\"/></a></p>\n<p><em>Source: DI, based on KDHS 2014 data</em></p>\n<p>Less than 30% of married women (15\u201349 years) use modern contraceptive methods in nine counties as illustrated in Figure 3.

Eliminating health inequalities needs development and investment into effective pro-poor public health interventions at national and county levels. Of particular concern in doing so effectively is the lack of publicly available data disaggregated at ward and village level to facilitate analysis of intra-county health inequalities and inequities. Collection, sharing and use of disaggregated data on health needs is critical to targeting interventions and should be prioritised by decision-makers, including through new collaboration with CSOs and other non-government data experts.</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Harnessing the power of data to tackle inequality ...", "author": ["Henry Odhiambo"], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "27 Nov 2017", "description": "DI launches the Spotlight on Kenya to help increase the uptake of available official data in meeting and monitoring the country\u2019s development commitments.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/harnessing-power-data-tackle-inequality-reduce-poverty-kenya/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>In Kenya, both county as well as national governments are key in fighting inequality and poverty reduction, but county governments particularly are experiencing huge gaps in terms of data collection, the open availability of data and analysis for evidenced-based decision-making. Additionally, some non-official actors such as NGOs face difficulties in accessing, analysing and using data to support national and county governments in development work.</p>\n<p>The critical role of data in fighting poverty and inequality featured prominently in this month\u2019s Kenya <a href=\"http://www.kenyaequityweek.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Equity Week</a>, organised under the auspices of International Budget Partnership Kenya with participation and support from other organisations, including Development Initiatives (DI). There were calls for integration and interoperability of data between the producers; standardisation of data collection methodology to provide quality assurance; and making available more data in open formats for easy accessibility.</p>\n<p>Presentations from five counties (Elgeyo Marakwet, Samburu, Turkana, Busia and Makueni) revealed that some wards within the same counties are clearly being left behind in development, particularly with regard to good roads, education and access to clean water and health facilities. Quality data is essential in addressing this situation, as well as for informing ongoing development plans, such as the 2018\u20132022 County Integrated Development Plans.</p>\n<p>During Equity Week, DI launched the <a href=\"http://data.devinit.org/spotlight-on-kenya\" target=\"_blank\">Spotlight on Kenya</a>: an online data visualisation platform that seeks to help increase the uptake of available official data in meeting and monitoring the country\u2019s development commitments. Part of DI\u2019s <a href=\"http://data.devinit.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Development Data Hub</a>, the Spotlight brings together in one place the key available data from all 47 counties on socioeconomic indicators, financial resources and poverty indicators from such sources as the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS), the Ministry of Education, the Demographic and Health Surveys and county governments. Spotlight data can support decision-makers and accountability actors in their work to reduce poverty and improve sustainable development by enabling better analytical work on national development needs and the resources available to address them.</p>\n<p>In addition to initiatives like the Spotlight, stakeholders present at Kenya Equity Week also called for robust engagement both in government and beyond to increase use of data both for policy making and for accountability purposes. The production, sharing and use of quality data is widely acknowledged as a key prerequisite to achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals to ensure no one is being left behind. Sustained capacity building for citizens, especially at the grass-roots level, is essential to encourage data use for driving improvements in service delivery from government and the private sector.</p>\n<p>Increased collaboration between the government, civil society and private sector was also highlighted as a priority at the event, echoing growing global awareness on <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/common-cause-common-language-harmonising-key-concepts-in-the-data-revolution/\" target=\"_blank\">the need for an inclusive approach to producing, sharing and using data</a>. This should include mapping of stakeholders from various sectors, identifying their specific data needs and exploring how to support them. Some stakeholders from Kenya\u2019s health and education sectors in particular are already interested in finding out how data on the Spotlight can help with in-depth analysis of their sector.</p>\n<p>So what are the next steps? Progress has been made by national and county governments in the field of data, but challenges remain. A lack of, or difficulty in accessing timely, reliable, disaggregated and open data is still a major concern. For instance, the latest publicly available poverty data from KNBS was collected in 2005, more than a decade ago, and it may no longer be relevant for solving current development challenges. Data producers and funders should invest in regular collection, including the use of <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/long-term-investments-in-a-short-term-world-arguments-for-sustainable-data/\" target=\"_blank\">innovative approaches for gathering community-level data</a> and sharing of data as a demand-driven priority. Devolution presents a key opportunity for Kenya to address poverty and inequality by improving targeting resources at subnational level. Data-collection systems and analytical capacity in virtually all of the 47 counties require strengthening, and bridging the data gap between the data community and the county governments will require active collaboration.</p>\n<p>Supporting the increased use of data and information to reduce poverty and promote sustainable development in Kenya is critical. We at DI are keen to engage and discuss with all stakeholders working on the data agenda how such approaches as the Spotlight can support improved development outcomes through informed decision-making based on the best available evidence.</p>\n<p>For DI, the next steps include continuing to incorporate updated information into the Spotlight as it becomes available from official sources; DI is also keen to receive comments and suggestions from Spotlight users on how to make the platform even more user friendly. In addition, we are prioritising supporting stakeholders both at national and county level, mainly through our analytical work, to promote evidenced-based policy interventions.</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Supporting Nepal in the sharing and use of (open) ...", "author": ["Louisa Dennison"], "format": "Commentary blogs; Data blog", "date": "20 Nov 2017", "description": "A vibrant community of open data enthusiasts are advancing Nepal\u2019s data revolution through improvements in collecting and sharing digital data.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/supporting-nepal-sharing-use-open-data-development/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"><p>This blog is written by Louisa Dennison of DI and guest author<a href=\"https://asiafoundation.org/people/tirza-theunissen/\" target=\"_blank\"> Tirza Theunissen</a> of The Asia Foundation.</p>\n</div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>In August 2017 the worst monsoon rains for 15 years hit the Terai region of Nepal, causing flooding and landslides that affected 1.7 million of Nepal\u2019s citizens.

The first local elections in almost two decades were held this year, and a whole new set of data needs and gaps must now be addressed if the newly elected local officials are to be able to properly exercise their functions as mandated by Constitution.

Our aim was to foster international collaboration to make commonly used international data standards interoperable to help drive poverty eradication and sustainable development. Our logic was simple \u2013 there\u2019s more open data being produced than ever before, but currently much of it isn\u2019t being turned into useful information because it isn\u2019t being joined up with other data.</p>\n<p>We are proud of what we have been able to achieve in a relatively short space of time \u2013 raising the profile of this issue; running a\u00a0<a href=\"http://juds.joinedupdata.org/consultation-paper/\" target=\"_blank\">consultation</a>\u00a0process to move the conversation from a discussion about interoperability problems to a search for interoperability solutions; contributing to the formation of the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.data4sdgs.org/master-blog/2017/4/24/improving-data-interoperability-for-the-sdgs\" target=\"_blank\">Collaborative on SDG Data Interoperability</a>; producing a series of thought-provoking\u00a0<a href=\"http://juds.joinedupdata.org/discussion-papers/\" target=\"_blank\">technical discussion papers</a>; and, launching a set of open-source<a href=\"http://joinedupdata.org/en/about/\" target=\"_blank\">\u00a0tools</a>\u00a0that enable data users to map international standards in a comparable way \u2013 but we realise that this project has been more about\u00a0<em>starting</em>\u00a0a conversation than offering definitive solutions.</p>\n<p>\u2018Interoperability\u2019 means different things to different people. It\u2019s more than just a technical term, it\u2019s about solving real-world problems in a joined-up way. Our new policy paper\u00a0<em><a href=\"http://juds.joinedupdata.org/the-frontiers-of-data-interoperability-for-sustainable-development/\" target=\"_blank\">The frontiers of data interoperability for sustainable development</a>\u00a0</em>explores the concept in more detail. It also sets out where we believe the frontiers of interoperability policy lie \u2013 where progress is being made and challenges persist.</p>\n<p>Regardless of how individual stakeholders may approach interoperability challenges, one thing everyone we spoke to when producing our paper agreed on is that interoperability must be a priority for the data revolution. This is because the demand for useful and usable information \u2013 produced from contextualised, joined-up, interoperable data \u2013 is the key driver in the creation of the sustainable data infrastructures that will ensure that all people can be counted repeatedly and cost-effectively so that no one is left behind.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>\u201cInteroperability is not just about technology standards, but also knowledge-sharing,</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>the development of sustainable (sub)national capacity and systems,</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>harnessing political support for data, and increasing investments in information</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>and official statistical production.\u201d</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The frontiers of interoperability for sustainable development</p>\n<p>Our policy paper highlights a number of sector-specific examples where interoperable solutions have benefited front-line decision-makers. For instance, the\u00a0<a href=\"https://ohie.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Open Health Information Exchange</a>\u00a0evolved from the Rwanda Health Information Exchange (the development of which was led by the Rwandan Ministry of Health itself) with support from international entities. What examples such as OpenHIE highlight is that interoperability solutions can reduce the time, effort and cost of data collection that is routine in many countries; minimise the frustration and risks associated with finding inconsistent and incomplete data; and, make available, sustainable, disaggregated data for effective decision-making at (sub)national level.</p>\n<p>These benefits need to be scaled up within and, more importantly,\u00a0<em>across</em>\u00a0sectors. Change at scale will happen only if international coordination helps stakeholders forge common understandings of what solving problems in a joined-up way means in reality. This is why we believe that the Collaborative is so important. The Collaborative can play a crucial role in furthering progress that has already been made and tackling future challenges in interoperability policy. In our paper we suggest four areas that we believe the Collaborative should structure its work around as it moves forward:</p>\n<div class=\"mythemes-sh-list unordered rounded normal\">\n<ul>\n<li><i class=\"mythemes-icon-\"></i>\n<div>Facilitating coordination across and between data communities and the broader development community.</div>\n</li>\n<li><i class=\"mythemes-icon-\"></i>\n<div>Supporting national actors to put in place the resources required to meet and measure the SDGs.</div>\n</li>\n<li><i class=\"mythemes-icon-\"></i>\n<div>Providing recommendations, guidance and new opportunities to empower governments to reap the benefits of interoperable data for decision-making and monitoring at the national level.</div>\n</li>\n<li><i class=\"mythemes-icon-\"></i>\n<div>Catalysing the formation of new synergies across communities and between technical and policy stakeholders to develop new projects, approaches and partnerships across and within systems.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>As the Collaborative moves the interoperability agenda forward towards the second\u00a0<a href=\"https://undataforum.org/\" target=\"_blank\">UN World Data Forum</a>\u00a0in October 2018, it will need to continue to build and foster a shared appreciation of the problems and solutions that exist across different data and professional communities. From our side, the JUDS project has been an exciting ride and one of the most successful two-year projects either of us has worked on.

In 2016, governments agreed to <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/dac/DAC-HLM-Communique-2016.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">new rules that allow for a wider set of peace and security activities to be counted as official development assistance (ODA)</a>.\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/officialdocuments/publicdisplaydocumentpdf/?cote=DCD/DAC(2017)22/FINAL&amp;docLanguage=En\" target=\"_blank\">The revised casebook</a>, published in late October 2017, provides a catalogue of case studies to demonstrate the application of these new rules.</p>\n<p>Whilst the casebook is a useful resource that provides evidence of how the rules have been interpreted by different donors and implementing agencies, it is largely illustrative and falls short of clarifying actual rules.</p>\n<p>The option to reopen discussions on these rules is not on the table, but there is room for the OECD DAC to consider how to better define them and, in particular, the key terms used. One way to achieve this could be through an addendum or annex to the casebook, providing definitions and information on the types of activities that are and aren\u2019t captured under key terms. This clarification is critical to ensure greater transparency around donor spending on peace and security, and to strengthen consistency in donor reporting. It also addresses the risk that, depending on how the new rules are interpreted, resources could be diverted away from development and poverty-reduction-focused activities in favour of those that align with national security and political priorities (i.e. those less aligned with the primary objective of ODA \u2013 \u201cto promote the economic development and welfare of countries\u201d<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a>).</p>\n<p>While the need for greater clarity on key terms is applicable to the new rules in general, there are three aspects where this is particularly notable:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Defining and clarifying the activities that are captured under the terms \u2018routine police functions\u2019 and \u2018non-lethal equipment and training\u2019</strong>. The rules say that activities supporting partner country police with regard to \u201cfinancing for police functions pursuant to preventing and addressing criminal activities, and the provision of related non-lethal equipment and training in the context of countering transnational organised crime<em>\u201d</em> can be counted as ODA (Para 6), and examples of support provided to partner country police are outlined in the casebook, such as Guinea-Bissau and Liberia (e.g. case 23).</p>\n<p>Both terms include activities that under the broad framework of \u2018public safety\u2019 provision could cause physical harm to the public in certain fragile and conflict contexts. For example, \u2018routine police functions\u2019 can include coercive law enforcement measures. \u2018Non\u2019 or \u2018less\u2019 lethal training/equipment can refer to the use of a range of pain-inducing (whilst not deadly) weapons such as tear gas, pepper spray and sleep gas. Used in contexts where there is a governance vacuum (such as Guinea-Bissau) and law enforcement agencies are a party to the conflict, this could result in the exacerbation of human rights abuses and impunity.</p>\n<p>Further clarity and guidance should be provided to specify which \u2018routine policing functions\u2019 count as ODA and in which contexts the provision of non-lethal equipment equipment/training can be used as ODA. A prerequisite of using ODA in this context should be completion of a full risk and conflict assessment and training that includes a focus on how to use non-lethal equipment responsibility and in line with human rights standards.</p>\n<p>The arguments presented here are based on an (understood) assumption that ODA <em>cannot</em> be used for any activities that cause harm to citizens, even when a law enforcement agency is responding to a security threat and defending public safety. However, as there is no formal clarification of this in the current definition of ODA, this is open to interpretation and clear guidelines are urgently needed.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Clarifying which intelligence activities are considered to be \u2018development focused\u2019 and count as ODA</strong>. The rules say that training in gathering intelligence on political activities cannot be counted as ODA. However, they do allow for data collection for development purposes, or preventative or investigatory activities by law enforcement agencies in the context of routine policing to uphold the rule of law, including countering transnational organised crime.</p>\n<p>While the casebook includes examples of where support to routine police functions has included support to investigation agencies, without definitions of key terms (such as \u2018investigatory\u2019 and \u2018countering transnational organised crime\u2019) and parameters guiding the types of intelligence activities considered to be \u2018development focused\u2019 (can be counted as ODA), there is a risk that donor interpretations will differ. This could lead to inconsistent reporting and the use of ODA for intelligence work that is more aligned to donor national security priorities, than to a development or poverty-reduction agenda.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Establishing the parameters for activities with a \u2018development\u2019 or \u2018civilian\u2019 purpose</strong>. Some cases outlined are deemed ODA eligible on the broad basis that the \u2018purpose is civilian\u2019 or the project provides a \u2018development service\u2019 (e.g. case 7). Guidance should be developed on the human security and poverty-reduction outcomes of a project to be classified as having a \u2018development\u2019 or \u2018civilian\u2019 purpose (e.g. number of vulnerable and insecure civilians that are directly and indirectly targeted through a project, and outcomes that have specifically strengthened people\u2019s livelihoods and security). Without this, there is a risk that ODA could be diverted for use in a wider set of peace and security activities.</p>\n<h4><strong>Broader questions around defining and reporting on ODA </strong></h4>\n<p>The necessary clarifications highlighted above illustrate a broader need for improved evidence \u2013 not just for peace and security but for all reported ODA \u2013 on the ways in which ODA contributes to poverty reduction and development. Currently, it is enough for reporting agencies to state that the project has a \u2018development\u2019 focus. To strengthen transparency of ODA, clearer outcome-orientated guidelines are needed that set out the minimum requirements and targets on who will benefit and how \u2013 targets that must be reached for a project to meet the criteria for having promoted \u2018economic development\u2019 or the \u2018welfare of developing countries\u2019 as per the definition of ODA.</p>\n<p>Photo: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/dfid/4479564824/in/photolist-7PQUyw-7PMMMM-7PQYFY-85Bm7a-7PQUf5-7PMLx2-bjf9rK-7PR2nf-7PQWyh-bjf9KV-bjfaCe-7PR1jG-bjf5dg-Luwpg4-bjfbiD-amRhEc-7PMQ4Z-bjf9TF-bjfa16-bjf5AM-bjf8it-dYoo86-bjf5p6-bjfb1c-amAphE-amRhAD-7PMHgi-bjfbpM-bjf7vR-bjfaUv-bjfafT-bjf6AF-bjfaLi-9umW81-bjfa98-amArss-amADFL-bjfavF-bjf61V-amAubC-amxJSc-amAFtq-amRgY4-amU73W-amxH8R-bjfbat-amxMN2-amRgRM-amRhGr-amU6iE/\" target=\"_blank\">UK Department for International Development</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</div><div class=\"row--cards\" ng-if=\"post.notes\">\n<div class=\"col-md-12 card m-b--2\">\n<div class=\"card__content bg--light\">\n<h3 class=\"h3\">Notes</h3>\n<div> <p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\">[1]</a> OECD DAC (2008), Factsheet: Is it ODA? <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/34086975.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/34086975.pdf</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"}, {"title": "New principles for DAC donors on blended finance", "author": ["Cordelia Lonsdale"], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "06 Nov 2017", "description": "DI's Cornelia Lonsdale reviews the OECD DAC's new guidance on blended finance for development - including what they got right, and what should happen next.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/new-principles-dac-donors-blended-finance-commit-increasing-transparency-accountability-development-impacts/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"><p>But who will monitor whether they deliver, and how?</p>\n</div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>At its High Level Meeting last week, the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) adopted a new set of principles (Annex 1 in their <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/dac/DAC-HLM-2017-Communique.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">communiqu\u00e9</a>), providing high-level policy guidance on the use of <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/di-kicks-off-project-on-blended-public%E2%88%92private-finance-for-development/\" target=\"_blank\">blended finance</a> for development. The principles were developed with the inputs of a multi-stakeholder senior advisory group set up by the OECD, in which I took part. Here I\u2019ll share some thoughts on what the principles get right \u2013 and what should happen next.</p>\n<p>The five principles are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Anchor blended finance use to a development rationale</li>\n<li>Design blended finance to increase the mobilisation of commercial finance</li>\n<li>Tailor blended finance to local context</li>\n<li>Focus on effective partnering for blended finance</li>\n<li>Monitor blended finance for transparency and results.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A preface in a separate OECD <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/dac/Blended%20Finance%20flyer%20DAC%20HLM%202017.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">document</a> defines blended finance as \u201cthe strategic use of development finance for the mobilisation of additional finance towards the SDGs in developing countries\u201d, with \u2018additional finance\u2019 referring primarily to commercial finance<em>.</em> The Annex of the October communiqu\u00e9 gives the outline of each principle, followed by a short rationale, and then a few sentences on the \u2018how\u2019.</p>\n<h4><strong>What\u2019s good?</strong></h4>\n<p>Well, we now have policy principles: this is fairly significant in itself. When we started work on blended finance in late 2015, donors rarely had blended finance policies or strategies \u2013 at least, not public ones. (Also, until recently, they had been unable to count much aid to the private sector, including \u2018blended finance\u2019, as ODA \u2013 a situation that has also just changed, as <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/next-private-sector-instruments/\" target=\"_blank\">my colleague Rob Tew explains</a>.)</p>\n<p>Principle 5, \u201cMonitor blended finance for transparency and results\u201d, is the one I\u2019m happiest about, and the one I least expected to see in the principles. Many are cautious about transparency in blending, because the involvement of private-sector investors may raise issues around commercial confidentiality. Better yet, this principle also has a subsection calling for actors to \u201cEnsure public transparency and accountability on blended finance operations\u201d. Now, to ensure transparency and accountability, clarification is needed on which actor is responsible for publishing which data, in what formats, and to which stakeholders. There should also be a discussion around existing reporting frameworks used by DAC donors, such as DAC statistics and the IATI Standard \u2013 donors could commit to dialogue on shaping these specifically to enhance transparency in blending. DAC statistics and IATI have complementary roles to play in getting better data on blended finance out there: DAC statistics as the most comprehensive official source of donors\u2019 aid activities, coupled with IATI\u2019s ability to record data on individual transactions and track the passing of funds through the hands of multiple actors. There\u2019s an opportunity for progress, and those DAC donors engaged in IATI could play a crucial role in driving this.</p>\n<h4>What could be better?</h4>\n<p>Let\u2019s talk about the OECD\u2019s definition of blended finance I mentioned earlier, a definition the senior advisory group couldn\u2019t easily agree on. Some donors feel that \u2018blended finance\u2019 describes the use of concessional public resources to leverage less-concessional public resources, for example, an EU grant \u2018blended\u2019 with an EU loan. Others (it might be fair to say most)<a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\">[1]</a> see blended finance as the use of development finance (often ODA) to de-risk or otherwise \u2018leverage\u2019 commercial resources.</p>\n<p>The compromise the OECD has ended up with seems to capture both, but also somehow neither. This isn\u2019t ideal: donors are likely to scale up private-sector instruments rapidly, now they can report them as ODA, but the risks in using ODA for engaging the private sector in development through blending need careful navigation \u2013 the development community needs to ensure the most is made of this opportunity, but that the approach is responsible.</p>\n<p>The act of \u2018blending\u2019 two types of public development resource is very different from leveraging investments from a commercial bank into a development project \u2013 and the principles appropriate to one scenario would likely be rather different from principles relevant to the other. Hopefully, now the meeting is over, the DAC can take swift steps towards more specific policy guidance for ODA\u2013private blending.</p>\n<p>We need the OECD to clarify quickly how and when detailed policy guidance will be developed to support these principles, which \u2013 while perfectly fine \u2013 are also quite generic and top line. They\u2019re hard to be offended by (which is good as far as facilitating further dialogue goes) but is also a drawback in terms of supporting donors in implementation. For example, Principle 1, the \u2018development principle\u2019, is not clear to what extent the various actors \u2013 donors, private investors or investees \u2013 are responsible for delivering positive development impacts, or how to mitigate risks such investments may pose to poor and vulnerable people and communities. It doesn\u2019t mention how to assess the comparative advantages of using ODA for blended finance over and above other kinds of development intervention in specific contexts, sectors, etc \u2013 an assessment that should be used to justify this use of aid. The policy guidance should address this, drawing on expertise of DAC members.</p>\n<p>Finally, my biggest concern. At the High Level Meeting, the DAC was apparently not in a position to commit to systematic monitoring of blended finance (for example, in peer reviews) \u2013 despite committing as a membership to drive it forward. The principles seem to leave monitoring up to the individual providers. As <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/blended-finance-understanding-its-potential/#\" target=\"_blank\">our report</a> last year highlighted, monitoring blending and getting better evidence on its impacts is critical. The communiqu\u00e9 states that the DAC sees \u201csignificant potential for blended finance to mobilise private investments towards sustainable development\u201d. Hopefully, the DAC will be able to propose a more concrete role for itself in due course, as it\u2019s well placed to monitor whether or not this potential is actually being realised \u2013 and whether the principles are being upheld by its members.</p>\n<p>For more information about ODA modernisation, you can watch our\u00a0<a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/changing-rules-of-aid-understanding-oda-modernisation/\" target=\"_blank\">animation\u00a0</a>and read our\u00a0<a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/oda-modernisation-background-paper-changing-rules-aid/\" target=\"_blank\">background paper</a></p>\n<p>Image: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/asiandevelopmentbank/8428296281/in/album-72157680230715083/\" target=\"_blank\">Asian Development Bank</a></p>\n</div><div class=\"row--cards\" ng-if=\"post.notes\">\n<div class=\"col-md-12 card m-b--2\">\n<div class=\"card__content bg--light\">\n<h3 class=\"h3\">Notes</h3>\n<div> <p><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\">[1]</a>\u00a0DI reviewed all the existing definitions of blended finance in the <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/the-role-of-blended-finance-in-the-2030-agenda-setting-out-our-analytical-approach/#\" target=\"_blank\">annex of our 2015 discussion paper.</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"}, {"title": "What next for private sector instruments?", "author": ["Rob Tew"], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "03 Nov 2017", "description": "Failure to agree on new rules raises questions about a major piece of Offical Development Assistance (ODA), creating uncertainty on what ODA actually means.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/next-private-sector-instruments/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"><h3>Failure to agree new rules raises questions about a major piece of ODA reform</h3>\n</div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>For many years OECD DAC members have invested in the private sector of developing countries, often through development finance institutions (DFIs) \u2013 organisations set up by the donors specifically to make and manage such investments. However, much of this support to the private sector was not eligible to be counted as ODA \u2013 loans to private sector companies are typically less concessional than loans to governments and do not meet the criteria for inclusion within ODA. Also, some of the support was in the form of guarantees, which were not allowable as ODA regardless of the terms. The DAC wanted to incentivise greater support for the private sector in developing countries and so at <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/dac/OECD%20DAC%20HLM%20Communique.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">the 2014 HLM</a> they signalled that, in future, more investments in private-sector development would be allowed to be counted as ODA. These newly ODA-eligible investments became known as private sector instruments (PSIs).</p>\n<p>This year, 2017, was supposed to be the year when the rules governing PSIs were to be agreed. There were to be two ways in which donors could count their support to the private sector as ODA \u2013 known as the institutional approach and the instrument approach. Donors could either count capital funds passed to a DFI as ODA (the institutional approach) or they could count a percentage of the investments made by the DFI in developing countries as ODA (the instrument approach). In order to count funding to a DFI as ODA under the institutional approach, the DFI concerned would have to be assessed by the DAC in order to ensure that its investments were actually development oriented. The percentage of the investment counted as ODA under the instrument approach (known as the \u2018grant element\u2019) would be calculated for each investment and would depend on the terms of the deal (length of loan, interest rate, guarantee premium, etc). The softer the loan or the lower the guarantee premium, the higher the grant element and therefore the higher the percentage counted as ODA.</p>\n<p>Yet agreement on the rules has proved elusive. DAC members disagreed on how high the percentage counted as ODA should be for each investment. Some members were concerned that if an investment were at, or near to, market terms, counting too much of this investment as ODA would undermine the concept of ODA itself \u2013 this is, after all, a fundamental change in the nature of ODA since, in the past, funding has always had to be given on a concessional basis to qualify as ODA. These donors therefore wanted to calculate the grant element in such a way that a relatively small proportion of each investment would be ODA-eligible. Other donors, however, wanted to increase the incentives for providing PSIs, and so proposed to count a higher percentage of each investment as ODA. Gaining agreement between these two perspectives proved impossible \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/dac/DAC-HLM-2017-Communique.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">communiqu\u00e9 following the recent DAC HLM</a> contained the blunt statement: \u201cWe note that at this stage we were not able to conclude in the spirit of consensus our negotiation.\u201d</p>\n<p>So where does this leave us? The communiqu\u00e9 puts it like this:</p>\n<p><em>\u201cPending an agreement on the Implementation details of all the PSI principles, the donor effort may be measured either at the point of transfer of funds to a vehicle providing PSI to developing countries or for each PSI transaction between the vehicle and the private enterprise or institution in the partner country. We clarify that this relates to PSI that are development-oriented.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>So \u2013 it would appear that donors are still going to be able to count PSI investments as ODA, despite the fact that no agreed rules exist on how much should be counted. These circumstances present multiple, unanswered questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the absence of agreement on the calculation of grant element, will donors wishing to use the instrument method report their PSI ODA on a cashflow basis \u2013 new investments from DFIs minus proceeds from the sale of investments? This will make ODA on PSI loans inconsistent with ODA on sovereign loans as these, in future, will be counted in ODA using a grant-element basis.</li>\n<li>What about guarantees? Will donors be allowed to count the full face value of guarantees that are called in? This approach to guarantees was previously rejected on the grounds that it had the effect of rewarding bad investment decisions.</li>\n<li>Donors using the institutional approach will, presumably, be allowed to count funding to DFIs as ODA even if those DFIs have not had their developmental impact assessed by the DAC (in 2015 the UK and Belgium started to count funding to their DFIs as ODA in anticipation of the rule changes).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is clearly an unsatisfactory situation. If donors are allowed to report PSIs as ODA without a clear set of agreed rules, then there are real risks that donor reporting will not only be inconsistent but also investments that should not count (or not wholly count) as ODA <em>will</em> be included in donors\u2019 ODA reporting. Transparency may be affected if donors observe different rules and institutional investments are made in DFIs with no information on how those funds were used in developing countries.</p>\n<p>Such uncertainties will serve only to undermine confidence in ODA and the statistics that the DAC provide. ODA is a limited but vital resource in the fight against global poverty. Anything that diminishes trust in the concept of ODA jeopardises attempts to ensure it is used effectively. Surely it would be better not to include PSIs in ODA at all until the current impasse is resolved and the rules around PSIs are agreed?</p>\n<p>For more information about ODA modernisation, you can watch our <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/changing-rules-of-aid-understanding-oda-modernisation/\" target=\"_blank\">animation </a>and read our <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/oda-modernisation-background-paper-changing-rules-aid/\" target=\"_blank\">background paper</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldbank/32737785713/in/photolist-RSVH8g-p7Z4J6-85QuQF-rfbkD8-Xt7PaJ-VeeYJd-pWi5Rr-ppbT66-RQnytQ-hijUps-Sx1TB1-pWr9L1-frhtTd-pDXLpA-p7YcbL-8s4G5X-saTEEg-pprAgW-cmfhYb-8mnxpo-SLpEtE-8MneV3-TRoLp6-97ajnn-eXj12u-9NAqQe-pptb9g-re6c3B-8TmuFn-U1ZdhS-85TpHJ-V4hu5E-T7VWkP-8mjo7c-pdq2yo-3cjrwC-pptdwc-n2VtAW-rTir3o-rRyHT8-rTrsMa-8kvHhn-rTjyAu-p7XSA8-5sL1NB-gVUZP1-9NJAiA-saKg8u-CDUktd-p7YfxA/\" target=\"_blank\">Photo:\u00a0Hendri Lombard/World Bank</a></p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "The UK\u2019s 'Irma exemption' should prompt a broade...", "author": ["Cordelia Lonsdale"], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "30 Oct 2017", "description": "An opportunity for the DAC to start evidence-based discussions about the long-term need for ODA that\u2019s responsive to crises in aftermath of Hurricane Irma", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/uk-irma-proposal-oda/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>Today the UK is making the case at the High Level Meeting of the OECD DAC to give official development assistance (ODA) to some British Overseas Territories (BOTs) \u2013 including Anguilla, Turks and Caicos and British Virgin Islands \u2013 which have all been ineligible for ODA for some years. The idea is that the BOTs are given special dispensation to return to the list of ODA-eligible countries for 36 months. This \u2018emergency waiver\u2019 would allow the UK to report as ODA the money it wants to spend on helping the BOTs in their response to Hurricane Irma.</p>\n<p>In DI\u2019s view, there are two decisions to be made by the DAC. First: whether the current ODA eligibility architecture enables an adequate response to countries experiencing crises \u2013 and if not, how we could improve it. And second, whether or not to grant the UK\u2019s request for a waiver.</p>\n<p>On the first point, we think this is a valuable and important discussion to have. Gross national income (GNI) data is not a particularly useful indicator of need or development progress, and therefore <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/income-status-basis-aid-allocation-decisions/\" target=\"_blank\">not the best guide for decision-making about aid</a>, particularly in a crisis setting. Developing countries trying to achieve the sustainable development goals (SDGs) are looking to make progress on a range of indicators \u2013 not just income; and the official GNI of the BOTs was calculated before the disaster, so it probably bears little resemblance to the reality on the ground today. There is a case to be made for a more sophisticated approach to allocation decisions, which takes into account developmental indicators (poverty rates; health and wellbeing indicators; a country\u2019s vulnerability to crisis and fragility). For countries that are making progress towards the SDGs, providing a quicker response to an emergency \u2013 not waiting for the GNI figures to put a country back on the list, but acting now \u2013 might help prevent a long-term developmental backslide caused by a crisis. Such a slide could have a serious impact on the wellbeing of affected populations (and may be more costly for donors and countries in the long-term). In this regard, DFID\u2019s proposals are on the right track.</p>\n<p>That said, it\u2019s critically important to ensure ODA is not diverted from the poorest countries. They also face significant\u00a0challenges responding to crises, such as hurricanes like Irma. DI analysis shows that most people living in extreme poverty are also <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/intrinsic-links-poverty-crisis-data-tells-us/\" target=\"_blank\">living in countries affected by fragility, environmental vulnerability or both</a> (87%, or 661 million people). Some long-term <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/new-research-highlights-africas-challenge-of-both-protracted-and-forgotten-humanitarian-crises/\" target=\"_blank\">\u2018forgotten crises\u2019</a>, such as that in Algeria, remain in need of international support, while new ones, such as in Libya, emerge. Additionally, forthcoming DI research highlights a set of countries, many in Africa, that global efforts to end poverty are likely to leave behind \u2013 unless something in the current financing picture changes. DAC members need to have this context in mind as they take decisions.</p>\n<p>Having an evidence-based discussion about the long-term need for ODA that\u2019s more responsive to crises is a good idea but rushing through a short-term, one-off decision is not. Decisions with potential long-term impacts need to be made by consensus. Proposals should also be based on evidence, data and careful discussion, and subject to input from civil society, parliamentarians, developing countries and independent experts.</p>\n<p>So what would a good short-term outcome at the DAC HLM this week be? The \u2018Irma exemption\u2019 proposal from the UK should prompt a long-term, comprehensive review of how well ODA rules reflect the needs of middle-income countries experiencing crises. In response to the UK\u2019s immediate proposal, the DAC could set up a short-term working group to examine what additional criteria should be considered alongside GNI to gauge ODA eligibility of non-ODA eligible countries in crisis (they could also determine whether an exemption or waiver for BOTs is appropriate). In the long-term, they should also commit to more far-reaching dialogue, to develop recommendations for how international assistance could be improved to respond to crises. The DAC could consider setting up a standing committee that considers temporary \u2018emergency status\u2019 re-entry to the ODA eligibility list, so that countries can provide \u2018emergency ODA\u2019 for countries experiencing crisis. (Such a committee would need to possess certain key features including responsiveness and transparency.)</p>\n<p>To avoid negative impacts on aid quality and quantity, there would need to be appropriate principles and caveats. \u2018Emergency ODA\u2019 would need to be verifiably focused on reconstruction and development. It should be additional to existing ODA (perhaps achieved by having a separate line reported to the DAC CRS). It should be untied, and reported to the <a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/\" target=\"_blank\">International Aid Transparency Initiative</a>. There also needs to be some explicit strategy for linking emergency response to long-term development goals of affected countries, including through supporting domestic investments in disaster preparedness.</p>\n<p>In a changing global landscape \u2013 where national income is failing as an indicator of the needs of countries\u2019 populations, and where crises are impacting on an ever-broadening group of people and countries \u2013 there is a real need to revisit the criteria defining access to international assistance (including, though not limited to, ODA). The UK can take a lead in these wider discussions, and should prioritise this over short-term efforts to adapt existing aid rules.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/dfid/37042485971/in/album-72157688805759935/\" target=\"_blank\">Image: MOD</a></p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "How to measure disability: survey usability versus...", "author": ["Beata Lisowska"], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "30 Oct 2017", "description": "This post details the complexities present when surveying disability, highlighting how having two competing surveying methods can be counterproductive.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/measure-disability-survey-usability-versus-usefulness/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>The concept of disability is complex and its definition often changes depending on who you ask.

These factors already make it tricky to measure disability itself, and this task becomes even more problematic in countries where disability is stigmatised, and people with disabilities are excluded from the scope of conventional official surveys. If every country adopts its own unique approach to defining and measuring disability, and understands disability differently or adopts a broader approach to a subject \u2013 at an international scale, you are left with a bunch of numbers that do not compare.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://juds.joinedupdata.org/how-to-measure-disability-survey-usability-versus-usefulness/dis-1/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1111\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1111\" height=\"331\" sizes=\"(max-width: 484px) 100vw, 484px\" src=\"http://juds.joinedupdata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dis-1.png\" srcset=\"http://juds.joinedupdata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dis-1.png 865w, http://juds.joinedupdata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dis-1-300x205.png 300w, http://juds.joinedupdata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dis-1-768x525.png 768w\" width=\"484\"/></a></p>\n<p><em>Source: Table taken from Jennifer H.

To address these, in July 2001 in New York, the UN Statistical Commission authorised the formation of a\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.washingtongroup-disability.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Washington Group (WG) on Disability Statistics</a>. This group, which now includes members from 135 countries, several international organisations and disabled people organisations, has spent the last 16 years developing and testing simple and effective means of measuring and obtaining comparative data on disability across countries.</p>\n<p>Their solutions are simple and nationally attainable \u2013 the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.washingtongroup-disability.com/washington-group-question-sets/short-set-of-disability-questions/\" target=\"_blank\">Short Set of six Disability Questions</a>\u00a0to be incorporated into censuses and surveys which primarily collect data on other topics, and the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.washingtongroup-disability.com/washington-group-question-sets/extended-set-of-disability-questions/\" target=\"_blank\">Extended Question Set on Functioning</a>\u00a0that comprises 37 questions for a more comprehensive assessment of disability in a given population. These questions cover main functional domains such as vision, hearing, mobility, cognition, affect (anxiety and depression), pain, fatigue, communication and upper body functioning \u2013 domains which are driven by the\u00a0<a href=\"http://apps.who.int/classifications/icfbrowser/\" target=\"_blank\">World Health Organization International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health classification</a>. Twenty-two countries have to date incorporated WG questions in their surveys or censuses \u2013 in some cases creating a baseline, in others (such as Uganda), starting to monitor the same disability indicators over time.</p>\n<p>It is clear that the WG is making significant progress in ensuring internationally comparable basic data on disability is reported and simple, short and easy questions are in place to be readily incorporated into national systems. It came as a surprise to many that a second survey was launched earlier this year, also focused on disability data.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe motivation for the Model Disability Survey (MDS) project of the World Health Organization and the World Bank arose from the recognition, clearly enunciated in the 2012 joint\u00a0<em><a href=\"http://www.who.int/disabilities/world_report/2011/en/\" target=\"_blank\">World report on disability</a></em>, that there is a worldwide need to collect comprehensive, comparable and relevant disability information that countries can use with confidence\u201d. The MDS provides both a comprehensive (over 320 questions) and a brief survey (15 questions). The intention is to use the former as a general population survey with modules that aim to provide detailed and nuanced information on people with and without disabilities; the latter is a set of supplementary questions that can be added to any survey on any other topic.</p>\n<p>I was curious to see how the two compared to each other.

As a pragmatist, however, I doubt that the comprehensive MDS will be used as widely as existing household surveys, such as DHS, MICS or LSMS. Like these existing and well-established surveys, it is lengthy (120\u2013150 minutes) and will take time \u2013 and a commitment to sustained funding over time \u2013 to plan, survey, recode and standardise. I fear that without committed and long-term resources, countries will carry out the brief MDS survey of 40 questions.</p>\n<p>If that is the case, with my Joined-up Data Standards hat on, I cannot help but notice that WHO\u2019s brief MDS stands in direct competition with the WG short set of questions.</p>\n<h4>Why?</h4>\n<p>The Washington Group has already made international reporting on disability a reality, with 22 countries to date incorporating and reporting on these questions in their censuses and surveys. Introducing the brief MDS as a direct and competing alternative negatively impacts the value of this achievement \u2013 the time and effort put into it over more than a decade, the extensive funding that supported the Group\u2019s work, and investment in surveys with questions that are no longer useful.</p>\n<p>So rather than competing and thereby compounding the issues around interoperable and comparable data, an alternative approach could be to continue using the WG set of questions for brief international reporting, and the complete MDS survey where countries can afford to conduct a full-scale disability survey within their borders with regular frequency. The bottom line is that surveys are costly. Getting them right, and getting usable data, can take years. To me, it\u2019s essential that data collection and use is simplified and supported \u2013 and the processes around that should enable and encourage take-up. Introducing two different systems of collecting the same information stands against that and international organisations should make the data world easier instead of complicating it further.</p>\n<p><em>This blog was written as a part of the\u00a0<a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/projects/joined-data-standards/\" target=\"_blank\">Joined-up Data Standards project</a>, a joint initiative between Development Initiatives and\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.publishwhatyoufund.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Publish What You Fund</a>.</em></p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "How is the World Bank changing its annual poverty ...", "author": ["Zach Christensen"], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "19 Oct 2017", "description": "The PovcalNet team provides an annual update of data for specific poverty surveys every year.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/how-is-the-world-bank-changing-its-annual-poverty-updates/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>The World Bank remains uniquely positioned to monitor global poverty. Countries share data with the World Bank that they don\u2019t share with anyone else. The World Bank has invested a significant amount of money into ensuring that data is internationally comparable, timely and methodologically sound. The <a href=\"http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/povOnDemand.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">World Bank\u2019s PovcalNet database</a>, which drives global estimates of poverty, was updated on 10 October 2017. The updates were good in some senses, but they also signified a step backwards for inclusive data.</p>\n<h3><strong>What\u2019s been added this year?</strong></h3>\n<p>Last year, the <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/world-bank-poverty-measurement-in-the-agenda-2030-era/\" target=\"_blank\">World Bank published recommendations of the Commission on Global Poverty</a>, also known as the Atkinson Commission. The latest PovcalNet update included some of the commission\u2019s recommendations. For instance, the PovcalNet website now makes it very simple to toggle between three major poverty lines (the traditional line of $1.90, a line at $3.20 and another at $5.50), and poverty estimates from high-income countries are included in main global poverty estimates. These changes should be celebrated.</p>\n<p>The latest PovcalNet updates also include estimates from the Middle East and North Africa, which were omitted in the last release due to concerns about purchasing power parity. This is certainly an improvement; however there are still challenges with the data. For instance, estimates for Syria (0.5% in extreme poverty) are based on a survey conducted in 2004, long before the protracted conflict there. Generally, though, the addition of Middle East and North Africa fills an important gap.</p>\n<p>The World Bank also added data from Myanmar for the first time. Anyone hoping to use PovcalNet to better understand the humanitarian crisis in Myanmar will not be able to draw insights from this data \u2013numbers aren\u2019t disaggregated by ethnicity or race, and so it\u2019s not clear if the Rohingya are included in the survey. Nevertheless, the addition of data from Myanmar is important.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/WhatIsNew.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">World Bank publishes a fairly detailed description of the updates</a>. One such update was to switch from defining poverty by income in Haiti (the norm for Latin American and Caribbean countries) to consumption (the norm for sub-Saharan African and Asian countries). This meant that Haiti went from having 53% of its population living in extreme poverty to 24%. Consequently, Haiti went from being the 13th poorest country in the world to being 36th.</p>\n<h3><strong>What\u2019s lost in this data update?</strong></h3>\n<p>The PovcalNet team provides an annual update of data for specific poverty surveys every year. These surveys typically take some time to process, so PovcalNet numbers are generally published for data collected three years ago. Many countries do not conduct surveys every year, so the World Bank has developed a method to line up surveys and estimate income levels between surveys. With the method for lining up data, it is possible to produce global estimates of poverty plus regional and national poverty estimate at the same time. Beginning in 2013, the World Bank began publishing annual estimates using these methods. With annual updates, it was possible to have reasonable estimates of trends in poverty. Starting last year, the updates from PovcalNet were analysed in the <em><a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/poverty-and-shared-prosperity\" target=\"_blank\">Poverty and Shared Prosperity</a></em> report.</p>\n<p>This year, PovcalNet added new surveys conducted since 2013 from about 70 countries, but it did not line up the data to provide global or regional estimates. This is somewhat surprising because the amount of effort required to publish the estimates is minimal compared with the effort put into adding the surveys. On top of this, some effort is required to find the newer data because 2013 data features more prominently.</p>\n<p>The World Bank has announced that the publication of global and regional estimates will be reduced to every other year, as will publication of the <em>Poverty and Shared Prosperity</em> report. The decision to turn away from annual analysis of progress against the World Bank\u2019s goals, and the corresponding Sustainable Development Goals, is unfortunate. <a href=\"http://blogs.worldbank.org/developmenttalk/2017-global-poverty-update-world-bank\" target=\"_blank\">The World Bank\u2019s blog</a> explains that year-on-year differences are usually insignificant for many countries so new data does not provide much additional information. This is true for many countries, but it is not always the case. For instance, PovcalNet reported that 6.47% of China\u2019s population was living in extreme poverty in 2012. By 2013 that number had dropped to 1.85%. The degree of change in a single year in the world\u2019s most populous country can hardly be dismissed as a small difference.</p>\n<p>The World Bank also argues that many changes in the annual estimates are based on extrapolation methods that may introduce errors. However, the reliance on extrapolated data is fundamentally a problem about infrequent data collection, not a problem with the frequency of extrapolation. Without more investments in data collection, biannual PovcalNet updates will be as dependent on extrapolation as annual updates. A better solution is to significantly increase investments in developing statistical systems to produce better, more frequent data.</p>\n<p>With very small investment the World Bank could increase the frequency of surveys and decrease the reliance on estimates. According to the <a href=\"http://paris21.org/press2017\" target=\"_blank\">latest estimates</a> from PARIS21, only 0.3% of official development assistance supports statistics. Doubling the spending on aid statistical systems would have a substantial impact on <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/dac/development-co-operation-report-20747721.htm\" target=\"_blank\">revolutionising</a> data for development. Despite this, the World Bank seems to decrease its funding for statistical capacity, making it likely that surveys will be less frequent. To further advance the goal of ending poverty and boosting shared prosperity, the World Bank could increase investment in poverty surveys and <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/some-thoughts-on-the-data-revolution-in-uganda/\" target=\"_blank\">broader investments</a> in national statistical systems.</p>\n<p>The World Bank\u2019s contribution to poverty measurement has been invaluable and they should be praised for their efforts to engage with experts to improve poverty data. We hope that they will continue to invest to improve systems in a valuable way and will not weaken their resolve to provide regular updates on progress towards their goals and the Global Goals to end poverty in all its forms everywhere.</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "New private sector instruments seen by stakeholder...", "author": ["Cordelia Lonsdale"], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "25 Sep 2017", "description": "Key questions and discussions from DI's webinar unpacking the modernisation of official development assistance", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/new-private-sector-instruments-seen-stakeholders-important-change-oda/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>The modernisation of official development assistance (ODA) comprises some of the biggest changes to official aid in decades.

Secondly, we wanted to connect with a wider group of stakeholders to raise awareness and discuss the implications of the changes, including what impacts the changes will have on existing \u2018traditional\u2019 ODA (grants, very concessional loans and technical cooperation).</p>\n<p>Attendees at the webinar encompassed a range of sectors and countries \u2013 CSOs, think tanks, governments, parliamentary researchers, private consultants and students. You can watch the recording of the presentation <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/oda-modernisation-background-paper-changing-rules-aid/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. Key concerns voiced in the question and discussion session that followed the webinar are captured below.</p>\n<h3><strong>Private sector instruments: the principal issue</strong></h3>\n<p>During the webinar we carried out a poll asking participants which area of ODA modernisation they considered most important:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/new-private-sector-instruments-seen-stakeholders-important-change-oda/webinar-poll-asking-which-area-of-oda-modernisation-is-most-important/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-15140\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15140\" height=\"407\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Webinar-poll-asking-which-area-of-ODA-modernisation-is-most-important.png\" width=\"664\"/></a></p>\n<p>The overwhelming response was private sector instruments (PSIs), the market-like instruments that may soon be a part of official aid.</p>\n<p>In fact, most of the questions from participants were on PSIs. The issue of whether \u2018subsidies\u2019 for the private sector should be allowed in development cooperation (when there are restrictions around this in trade and investment) was raised. This question is also on the table in official OECD discussions, and there is no easy answer.</p>\n<p>How PSIs will be reported and how/when this data will be made available was another area that received attention. Those interested in tied/untied aid, for example, will know it\u2019s important to be able to tell whether a private company receiving ODA is domiciled in the donor country or in the \u2018host country\u2019. The OECD is implementing a range of new channel codes as part of preparing datasets for PSI. These codes will enable donors to report more information about private-sector aid channels (assuming donors choose to use them).</p>\n<p>Others wanted to know how the \u2018private finance mobilised\u2019 by PSI will be reported alongside the ODA numbers. \u2018Amounts mobilised\u2019 won\u2019t count as ODA \u2013 but we understand they <em>will</em> be reported to the DAC annually. If the DAC makes this data publicly available, it will be possible to link additional funding mobilised from private-sector investors to specific ODA activities reported by donors. However, it will still not necessarily be possible to determine the extent to which this investment would have been made anyway without the donor funding. As PSIs are implemented, this concept (known as \u2018additionality\u2019) will be closely followed by those interested in the impacts and effectiveness of aid. PSIs are clearly an area requiring more clarity, and DI will produce further analysis as soon as more information is available. In the meantime, our recent work on <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/di-kicks-off-project-on-blended-public%E2%88%92private-finance-for-development/\" target=\"_blank\">blended finance</a> gives a sense of the financing instruments under discussion.</p>\n<h3><strong>Incentives, impacts on aid to LMICs, and South\u2013South Cooperation</strong></h3>\n<p>We also received questions about how providers of South\u2013South Cooperation might interface with this OECD process, and with related work on the concept of <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/tossd.htm\" target=\"_blank\">\u2018Total Official Support for Sustainable Development (TOSSD)\u2019</a>, which aims to engage these actors. Attendees also wanted clarity on the time frame for the rule changes and, finally, questions were raised about implications of the changes for some country groups, specifically low income countries (LICs). The new rules aim to provide incentives for donors to use PSI and ODA loans in these countries especially. To generalise, this will happen through awarding more ODA \u2018credit\u2019 to donors who provide ODA to LICs \u2013 the idea is that lending in these countries represents a greater risk on the part of the donor providing ODA, and this risk should be reflected in ODA data. Alongside these potentially positive incentives, which might direct much-needed financing to LICs, there may be knock-on effects on lower middle-income countries, which already face constraints on accessing concessional finance.</p>\n<p>There are so many other factors at play in decision-making around aid that it\u2019s hard to second-guess how ODA modernisation rule changes will affect donor behaviour. But it\u2019s clear that rule changes can create political incentives, as well as providing increased opportunities (and possibly also constraints) for development cooperation. We\u2019ll watch the process and data carefully and share our findings, so stay up to date by following us on social media or signing up for our newsletter\u2019.</p>\n<h4><strong>Learn more about ODA modernisation</strong></h4>\n<p><strong>Background paper and webinar recording:</strong>\u00a0<a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/oda-modernisation-background-paper-changing-rules-aid/\" target=\"_blank\">An introduction to ODA modernisation</a></p>\n<p><strong>Animated presentation:</strong>\u00a0<a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/changing-rules-of-aid-understanding-oda-modernisation/\" target=\"_blank\">Changing the rules of aid: understanding ODA modernisation</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Improving data on ageing to leave no one behind", "author": ["Zach Christensen"], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "11 Sep 2017", "description": "Getting equipped with the tools and ideology necessary to understand how ageing is linked to exclusion.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/improving-data-ageing-leave-no-one-behind/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>At the end of August, I participated in a meeting in Winchester, UK, with colleagues from national statistical offices, UN agencies, NGOs and academia, to discuss the need for better disaggregation by age and ageing-related statistics. The UK\u2019s Office of National Statistics hosted the technical group to lay the groundwork for the creation of the Titchfield City Group on Ageing and Age-disaggregated Data, which will provide expert recommendations to the UN Statistical Commission. Other city groups have significantly improved the collection of data, such as the <a href=\"http://www.washingtongroup-disability.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Washington Group</a>\u2019s work on disability statistics.</p>\n<p>In order to leave no one behind \u2013 a core aim of Agenda 2030\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals \u2013 we need to understand all the dimensions through which people are excluded. To gain an accurate picture and understand exclusion over a person\u2019s life cycle, it\u2019s vital that we disaggregate by age the data available on such issues as nutrition, poverty or disability. There are many challenges to collecting data on ageing, but three major issues emerge that impact the quality of policies on ageing in developing countries.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/key-facts-on-household-surveys/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Major surveys</strong></a><strong> collect little data on people aged over 49 </strong></h4>\n<p>USAID\u2019s Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and UNICEF\u2019s Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, two of the biggest tools for generating global statistics, focus primarily on children and women under the age of 49. This bias means that collectively we lack data on issues relevant to, although not limited to, older people. For example, although there is little data on domestic violence among people over 49, this doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t occur. Nor is there much global data on HIV/AIDS rates in older populations, yet case studies have shown that in some countries the highest prevalence of HIV/AIDS is among men over 49. For instance, Namibia\u2019s 2013 DHS expanded the age range of the questionnaires to include men and women age 15\u201365. They found that 11% of men aged 15\u201349 had HIV, compared to 16% of men 50\u201364. New tools are needed to capture issues relevant to older persons better and to highlight issues missed due to the age caps in the major surveys.</p>\n<h4><strong>Stereotypes about ageing lead to inadequate analysis </strong></h4>\n<p>Another problem is that many demographic analyses lump everyone aged above 60 into one group, despite the diversity that exists among them. Beyond the biological differences between a healthy 60 year old and a healthy 95 year old, the 60-plus population includes some of the world\u2019s most powerful and privileged people, as well as some of the most marginalised. A clear illustration of the challenges presented by age-related stereotypes is the oft-used dependency ratio. This analysis classifies everyone over 65 as dependent and assumes that they do not work for their living. This simply is not accurate for many over-65s, globally.</p>\n<h4><strong>The definition of a \u2018household\u2019 can matter </strong></h4>\n<p>The World Bank\u2019s measure of extreme poverty defines poverty at the household level. This can make it difficult to measure the wellbeing of older persons for several reasons. For example, if a person experiences an ageing-related disability, they will be less likely to live in a household independently. If they must join another household to survive, their consumption patterns may be significantly different from the rest of the household, but they would still be assigned the household level of poverty even if they were significantly better or worse off. The measure of poverty does not account for the changing needs of household members over the course of life. Additionally, most surveys don\u2019t include people living in institutions or staying in hospitals, excluding many at the very end of their lives.</p>\n<p>At Development Initiatives, we work on data to ensure that no one is left behind. Our <a href=\"http://devinit.org/p20i/\" target=\"_blank\">P20 Initiative</a> looks at the data on people in the poorest 20% of the global population \u2013 the P20. In our recent <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/p20-initiative-data-to-leave-no-one-behind/\" target=\"_blank\">P20 Initiative baseline report</a> we call for disaggregation by wealth quintile, gender, geography, age and disability. Through our analysis, we have found that the quality of the data available on people gets worse in higher age groups, particularly among the P20. One of the major reasons for this relates to civil registration and vital statistics systems: people in the P20 are far less likely to have their births and deaths registered. The <a href=\"https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/titchfield-city-group-ageing/\" target=\"_blank\">Titchfield City Group</a> provides a unique opportunity to ensure that we are equipped with tools and the ideology necessary to understand how age is linked to exclusion.</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Intrinsic links between poverty and crisis: What t...", "author": ["Sarah Dalrymple"], "format": "Data blog", "date": "18 Aug 2017", "description": "Information on needs & current resource allocation is vital to spend resources effectively.

Here, we find that 65% of the country\u2019s population are within the global P20 \u2013 that\u2019s approximately 112 million people. But what factors contribute to the likelihood of being in the global P20 in Nigeria? Well, if we compare the global P20 population in Nigeria against those living in the country\u2019s rural and urban areas, we find that 52% are in the global P20 and living in rural areas, compared with only 13% for those living in urban areas.</p>\n<h4>Figure 1. <a href=\"http://data.devinit.org/#!/who-are-the-global-p20?id=NG&amp;t=perc&amp;i1=p20&amp;i2=rural\" target=\"_blank\">Intersection of Nigeria\u2019s population within the global P20, and those living within the country\u2019s rural and urban areas</a></h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/figure-1-intersection-of-nigerias-population-within-the-global-p20-and-those-living-within-the-countrys-rural-and-urban-areas/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14986\" height=\"250\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Figure-1.-Intersection-of-Nigeria\u2019s-population-within-the-global-P20-and-those-living-within-the-country\u2019s-rural-and-urban-areas.png\" width=\"760\"/></a></p>\n<p>This tells us that in Nigeria, as in many other countries that are home to significant numbers of people living in poverty, you are much more likely to fall within the global P20 if you live in a rural area. But how does this intersect with other factors such as the presence of functioning civil registration and vital statistics systems (CRVS)? Civil registration ensures governments know that their citizens exist, when they were born and when they have died. Without functioning CRVS systems people remain invisible and uncounted, unable to claim their rights as citizens and more likely to be left behind.</p>\n<p>The percentage of births registered is a key indicator of a strong CRVS system. So what happens when we look at Nigeria? What we find is that 56% of under-fives in the P20 within Nigeria don\u2019t have their births registered. When we look at how this plays out between populations living in the country\u2019s rural and urban areas, we find that only 8% of those under five who live in urban areas and are within the global P20 in Nigeria don\u2019t have their birth registered, whereas this shoots up to 47% for those living in rural areas.</p>\n<h4>Figure 2. <a href=\"http://data.devinit.org/#!/who-are-the-global-p20?id=NG&amp;t=perc&amp;i1=p20&amp;i2=rural&amp;i3=no.birth.reg\" target=\"_blank\">Intersection between Nigeria\u2019s population within the global P20, those in the country with unregistered births, and those living in rural and urban areas</a></h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/figure-2-intersection-between-nigerias-population-within-the-global-p20-those-in-the-country-with-unregistered-births-and-those-living-in-rural-and/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14987\" height=\"259\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Figure-2.-Intersection-between-Nigeria\u2019s-population-within-the-global-P20-those-in-the-country-with-unregistered-births-and-those-living-in-rural-and.png\" width=\"760\"/></a></p>\n<p>Note: Some indicators measure for certain population groups only.

His words aimed to summarise a day filled with solutions to the problems in systems in developed, technically advanced Europe. My work mostly revolves around data and systems in developing countries, but I couldn\u2019t help but wonder whether some of the solutions discussed at the conference could be used by the governments, public administration, statistical offices and anyone else publishing and sharing data in developing countries. Here I unpack some of the solutions that may resonate beyond the confines of SEMIC.</p>\n<h3>Data governance</h3>\n<p>The main topic at the conference was the lessons learnt and challenges faced when implementing a data governance strategy at the national and institutional level. Data governance in\u00a0<a href=\"http://blogs.perficient.com/healthcare/blog/2012/06/12/data-governance-vs-data-management/\" target=\"_blank\">simple terms</a>\u00a0refers to processes for accessing and sharing data and resolving conflict when the processes don\u2019t work. The concept has existed since private organisations embraced the notion of data as an asset. If data is an asset it needs to be accessible and shareable, with proper data governance in place.</p>\n<p>Data governance is now the bread and butter of European public agencies, and this is reflected in the\u00a0<a href=\"https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/ckeditor_files/files/7_Session%20I_PRESA%20FEITH.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Luxembourg principles on open data portals</a>\u00a0where information is seen as an asset and must be accurate, integral, protected, accessible and up to date, and should be interoperable by default.</p>\n<p>In practice, sound principles and data governance can lead to some truly spectacular products that put citizens at the heart and that harmonise major public and private systems.\u00a0<a href=\"https://e-estonia.com/solutions/interoperability-services/x-road/\" target=\"_blank\">X-Road \u2013 Estonia\u2019s large data platform</a>\u00a0is a good example of this.</p>\n<h3>Creating the right culture</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA8lQslKsNE\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Van Landegem</a>\u00a0of the European Commission explained how its biggest problem is that staff do not always have all the information they need for their work. He mentioned information overload, new working methods and increasingly complex files, siloed data in the parts of the Commission, problems with the quality and robustness of data and information, and a lack of ethos of collaborative working. Sounds familiar?</p>\n<p>The Commission wants to \u2018walk the talk\u2019 and be a well-performing, innovative knowledge-based institution committed to evidence-based policy making. It acknowledges that to achieve this, the key aspects are: sharing skills and knowledge, finding and reusing good quality information and anticipating policy-making needs. Van Landegem emphasised the need for complete, reliable, relevant and accessible data/information/knowledge, and to foster a culture of cooperation, performance and innovation. As such, the Commission has developed 12 strategic objectives to achieve this:</p>\n<div class=\"mythemes-sh-list ordered rounded normal\">\n<ol>\n<li>\n<div>Ensure information responsibility</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>Establish corporate governance over information</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>Ensure system interoperability</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>Connect people</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>Map knowledge</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>Enable collaborative working methods</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>Develop data scientist methods</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>Exploit the potential of (big) data</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>Put in place the tools and infrastructure for data analytics</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>Become knowledge workers</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>Become learning organisation</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>Become and information aware organisation</div>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<p>More often than not these principles go hand in hand with the highly technical solutions used to apply them.

When faced with the problem of creating a curated catalogue of internal and external data for the user (an information asset catalogue), they started off with an assessment of their needs and focus (Figure 1) and ended up with a simple excel spreadsheet that presents a great first attempt at making their data easy to understand and retrieve by anyone who would like to make sense of it.</p>\n<h5>Figure 1: ECDC Information Asset Catalogue</h5>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\" wp-image-1045\" height=\"314\" sizes=\"(max-width: 433px) 100vw, 433px\" src=\"http://juds.joinedupdata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/blog-figure1-300x218.png\" srcset=\"http://juds.joinedupdata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/blog-figure1-300x218.png 300w, http://juds.joinedupdata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/blog-figure1-768x559.png 768w, http://juds.joinedupdata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/blog-figure1.png 865w\" width=\"433\"/></p>\n<h3>Addressing new demands</h3>\n<p>Eurostat spoke about its new policy around data dissemination. This is motivated by the European Commission corporate strategy that focuses on maximising the use of data for evidence-based policy-making.\u00a0<a href=\"https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/ckeditor_files/files/13_Session%20II_PRESA%20PURDEA.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Titus Purdea explored</a>\u00a0issues connected to this policy. These ranged from the demand to include on Eurostat an ever-broader range of data outside official data sources, to dealing with increased demand for ad-hoc statistics and for releasing more data towards partners and the research community. These seem to be the same demands that many national statistics offices are facing. In response Eurostat is adapting its IT architecture to deal with these issues.</p>\n<h5>Figure 2: Eurostat\u2019s potential IT architecture</h5>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\" wp-image-1046\" height=\"330\" sizes=\"(max-width: 439px) 100vw, 439px\" src=\"http://juds.joinedupdata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/blog-figure2-300x226.png\" srcset=\"http://juds.joinedupdata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/blog-figure2-300x226.png 300w, http://juds.joinedupdata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/blog-figure2-768x579.png 768w, http://juds.joinedupdata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/blog-figure2.png 865w\" width=\"439\"/></p>\n<h3>Shared concerns and lessons learnt</h3>\n</div>\n<p>Development Initiatives has recently published an excellent discussion paper written by Bernard Sabiti,\u00a0<a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/data-development-africa-ensuring-commitments-made-high-level-meeting-kenya-met/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Data for development in Africa. Ensuring commitments made at the High-level meeting in Kenya are met</em></a>. Bernard spells out the steps that need to be made by governments, donors and other actors to ensure the vision for development data in Africa becomes reality. He speaks of the need for collaboration between private companies, governments and other stakeholders \u2013 the main problem highlighted in each of the presentations at SEMIC. National statistical offices need to embrace change by dealing with non-official statistics , mirrors the steps Eurostat is taking to incorporate data from other sources into its own systems. And they need to connect to community data collection and engagement systems, so reinventing the role of civil society and other non-state actors. Finally, building capacity and walking the talk by \u2018putting money where the mouth is\u2019 resonated deeply at SEMIC.</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t get me wrong; the problems faced by developing countries are very different from those of EU countries. But the need to invest in sound and sustainable data systems, reusing solutions and principles are shared concerns in both contexts. In that case \u2013 can they learn from each other and exchange solutions? Especially if it aids in creating data systems that are published, disseminated, maintained and governed in a sustainable way?</p>\n<p>There is much to learn across different contexts, and I look forward to continuing to help identify useful approaches, solutions and principles that can be reused for sustainable progress of the developing countries.</p>\n<p><em>This blog was written as a part of the\u00a0<a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/projects/joined-data-standards/\" target=\"_blank\">Joined-up Data Standards project</a>, a joint initiative between Development Initiatives and\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.publishwhatyoufund.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Publish What You Fund</a>.</em></p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Two years in \u2013 are people\u2019s lives improving?", "author": ["Harpinder Collacott"], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "21 Jul 2017", "description": "Agenda 2030 is committed to ensuring no one is left behind - but to know who\u2019s left behind, you have to know who\u2019s included.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/two-years-peoples-lives-improving/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>The High Level Political Forum (HLPF), which took place over recent days in New York, was an opportunity to review progress in addressing the ambitious challenges of Agenda 2030. I was there to beat the drum for the critical role that better, disaggregated data will need to play if we\u2019re to truly leave no one behind.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year we launched a <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/p20-initiative-data-to-leave-no-one-behind/\" target=\"_blank\">report that established a baseline on the situation of the P20</a> \u2013 the poorest 20% of the world\u2019s population. A very clear and unsettling picture emerged from this baseline. Despite decades of talk about pro-poor and broad-based growth, the poorest 1.4 billion men, women and children share just 1% of the global income. Unless steps are taken, the gap between them and the rest of the world\u2019s population will continue to widen. This is a fundamental threat to the success of the Agenda 2030, with its central commitment to leave no one behind.</p>\n<p>Monitoring the progress of the P20 presents significant challenges. As we heard from a number of the countries submitting Voluntary National Reports (VNRs) this week, in many places the data to do so simply does not exist. If it does exist, it is often not sufficiently disaggregated to give a detailed picture at the individual level. As a result, governments do not have a clear picture of how these people\u2019s lives are changing, and they do not know what they can and should do to ensure the gap narrows rather than widens.</p>\n<p>To know who\u2019s left behind you have to know who\u2019s included \u2013 and the old model of measuring progress using national averages simply won\u2019t work. Yet with 17 Sustainable Development Goals, 169 targets and 230 indicators we risk making the picture so complex that the political imperative to end poverty and ensure no one is left behind gets lost. That is why the <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/projects/p20-initiative-data-leave-no-one-behind/\" target=\"_blank\">P20 Initiative</a> focuses on three simple indicators and asks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>are the poorest better off?</li>\n<li>are they better nourished?</li>\n<li>are they counted by their governments?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Improvements against any of these three indicators will unlock and lead to other improvements in the lives of the poorest people. And if we see positive changes against all three indicators, the poorest people will be on track to be included in global progress. However, participating in discussions throughout the past few days really brought home to me that time is short and the VNRs are not yet measuring any indicators to track progress on the commitment to leave no one behind. Urgent action is necessary on two fronts.</p>\n<p>First, decision-makers at the policy level should make it a benchmark of success that their interventions result in a measurable change in the income of the poorest 20% relative to the rest of the population. They must also measure progress against other social indicators, such as those outlined above. Improvement should be made across indicators to demonstrate progress. As the <a href=\"https://undocs.org/E/HLPF/2017/L.2\" target=\"_blank\">HLPF outcome document</a> recognises, reducing poverty is intrinsically linked to improvements in other areas: \u201c<em>Note with concern that poverty remains a principal cause of hunger and that an estimated 793 million people are still undernourished globally, 155 million children are stunted, and other forms of malnutrition are rising.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>If we don\u2019t start to measure something soon and try and drive change against it, we will fail to turn the commitment of leaving no one behind into action.</p>\n<p>Second, we need concerted investment in the collection, analysis and use of disaggregated data. My colleague and co-founder of DI Judith Randel highlighted this during a <a href=\"http://webtv.un.org/watch/9th-meeting-high-level-political-forum-on-sustainable-development-hlpf-2017-economic-and-social-council-2017-session/5508299680001\" target=\"_blank\">panel session at HLPF</a>. \u00a0She noted that \u201c<em>there must be a political demand to know who is excluded and who benefits \u2013 we need political and technical progress together\u201d.</em> We need greater coordination across sectors, joined-up data and practical commitments from key actors. We can be optimistic here; at the recent <a href=\"http://www.data4sdgs.org/high-level-meeting\" target=\"_blank\">High Level Meeting</a> on the data revolution in Nairobi there was <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/data-development-africa-ensuring-commitments-made-high-level-meeting-kenya-met/\" target=\"_blank\">demonstrable political momentum around investment in data</a>, with a number of specific commitments made by African governments and others too.</p>\n<p>Countries need clear roadmaps and frameworks on how to take disaggregation forward across all sectors, and avoid creating silos by focusing on just one aspect of individual data in isolation (e.g. gender). This also means making better use of existing data, for example from censuses and household surveys, and leveraging new, non-official data to address current data gaps. DI recently worked with <a href=\"http://www.sos-childrensvillages.org/\" target=\"_blank\">SOS Children\u2019s Villages</a> to launch <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/care-children-data-evidence-gaps-opportunities-change-sdgs/\" target=\"_blank\">a briefing looking at data on children outside of parental care</a> \u2013 a group likely to be left behind. As well as identifying the data gaps, we made recommendations on how to improve data so we can close these gaps and start to address the needs of these children now.</p>\n<p>We need to harness the energy of the data revolution, build on discussions and commitments, nurture and support the political will to use useful, good quality data to achieve the SDGs and make sure no one is left behind. And I echo Judith\u2019s closing comments: \u201c<em>we are lucky to be living in a time when data is a central pillar of the conversation\u201d</em>. \u00a0But, importantly, we must not wait until we have perfect data. We must use what we have and start to make progress against the goals.</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Why transparency and accountability should be a pr...", "author": ["Cordelia Lonsdale"], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "06 Jul 2017", "description": "In the case of blended finance, we really do need more transparency and accountability. Why? This blog by Cordelia Lonsdale explores two reasons", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/transparency-accountability-blended-finance/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>Oh no, I hear the reader sigh, not another blog about transparency and accountability from an NGO. But in the case of blended finance,<a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\">[i]</a> we really <em>do</em> need more transparency and accountability. Why? Two reasons:</p>\n<p>One: because the current picture has some serious transparency red flags (covered in detail in <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/blended-finance-understanding-its-potential/\" target=\"_blank\">our recent report</a>). The challenges of transparency in development finance institutions, key blended finance actors, are also well documented.<a href=\"#_edn2\" name=\"_ednref2\">[ii]</a></p>\n<p>Two: because when a substantial new financing agenda driven by some of the most influential bilateral donors and global institutions, and heavily reliant on the private sector for implementation, starts being rolled out in a big way, it\u2019s a useful time to re-examine what core development concepts mean to all of us, and ask how they can be useful to us in this new world.</p>\n<p>Here are key elements to think about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Trust and effective partnerships</strong>\u00a0Providing access to information, particularly the more qualitative information (What did you do? Who makes decisions, based on what?) can instil trust between partners \u2013 potentially very beneficial to the complex co-financing, multi-stakeholder arrangements on which blended finance relies.</li>\n<li><strong>Good monitoring, evaluation and reporting</strong>\u00a0Transparency, particularly when implemented by reporting data in a timely, granular and machine-readable fashion, can underpin effective monitoring and evaluation. This will be critical as we build a collective understanding of how blended finance impacts on development, job creation and poverty.</li>\n<li><strong>Accountability</strong>\u00a0The blended finance agenda is promoted in the spirit of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, committed to by governments \u2018on behalf of the people we serve\u2019. Many of the organisations putting resources into blending (donor government agencies and development finance institutions) are also publicly funded. The sector therefore has a responsibility to consider how best to deliver accountability to the public \u2013 and the intended beneficiaries.</li>\n<li><strong>Good decision-making</strong>\u00a0When trialling something new, we ideally need to understand how it works in relation to the existing approach \u2013 in this case, blended finance versus traditional ODA, in the form of grants and loans. If we don\u2019t have a transparent process for gathering information on where and how blended finance is being used globally, how will decision-makers know where it may be best suited, or where traditional forms of aid may still be needed?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This shouldn\u2019t be controversial \u2013 <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/aligning-blended-finance-to-busan-principles/\" target=\"_blank\">most of the actors involved have some commitment to transparency as a principle</a>, and try to uphold it in practice. Most of the objections to making blending more transparent seem to be practical implementation challenges. Here are a couple of common ones.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h4>\u2018Transparency is too bureaucratic/costly to implement, it\u2019s a public sector idea that doesn\u2019t translate to the private setting.\u2019</h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So let\u2019s talk about ways of doing transparency differently, using technology, innovation and ideas from private actors to add to the knowledge and experience of the development sector. We could improve on what we have currently \u2013 where you manually search through organisations\u2019 websites until you find a title of a project; get in touch; wait until the relevant person responds with what further detail they are allowed to give you \u2026 and then realise that the information you have isn\u2019t enough.<a href=\"#_edn3\" name=\"_ednref3\">[iii]</a> Feels like bureaucracy to me. Transparency, when done right, can help to <em>eliminate</em> bureaucracy and make things more efficient. How much better would it be to have an online, regularly updated source of blended finance data, searchable by government funder, fund manager, country, sector and type of financing instrument (perhaps with downloadable data in CSV)? Even better if it was integrated with existing reporting systems, such as the Development Assistance Committee\u2019s Creditor Reporting System, or <a href=\"http://www.aidtransparency.net/\" target=\"_blank\">IATI</a>.<a href=\"#_edn4\" name=\"_ednref4\">[iv]</a></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<h4>\u2018Blended finance deals need to be confidential \u2013 they\u2019re commercially sensitive\u2019.</h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What information would we actually <em>need</em> to achieve appropriate levels of transparency? We want to know whether it\u2019s a good use of public money (particularly official development assistance), being used for its intended purpose (economic development and job creation in developing countries). So</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the amount of public money/ODA put into the deal, and the amount of private money \u2018leveraged\u2019</li>\n<li>the country in which the investment was made and the sector of the investment</li>\n<li>the size/type of company being invested in; (note \u2013 not necessarily company names)</li>\n<li>the jurisdiction of the company (to verify whether local firms are benefiting from blended finance \u2013 part of blended finance\u2019s purpose is to create local jobs)</li>\n<li>the name of the implementing fund (the one managed by the financing institution), if one\u2019s involved</li>\n<li>the instruments through which the investment (or at least the public part of it) is being made (e.g. guarantee, loan, grant etc)</li>\n<li>the outline terms of the investment (at least of the public element of it)<a href=\"#_ednref5\" name=\"_edn5\">[v]</a></li>\n<li>the date of the deal being made.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As someone who believes in transparency, I\u2019m uncomfortable with saying that this kind of information is not in the public interest: DI have yet to see a convincing argument for why it would not be possible to provide this data, particularly if published, say, a year after the fact. <a href=\"https://www.open-contracting.org/2016/09/19/diving-deeper-commercial-confidentiality/\" target=\"_blank\">According to Open Contracting</a>, \u2018commercial confidentiality\u2019 is not a defined term: what is \u2018commercially sensitive\u2019 varies by jurisdiction (as do disclosure policies of development finance institutions). Information is deemed commercially sensitive when the release of the information \u201cis likely to harm the company\u2019s interests or competitiveness\u201d \u2013 this seems to be a subjective assessment that we could collectively rethink in relation to the individual items of data above. I\u2019d be interested to look at real-life examples and hear a funder\u2019s analysis as to whether there would actually be significant harm done to a company if data like this were released.</p>\n<p>Transparency should be a principle underpinning blended finance for development, in the spirit of good partnerships, effectiveness and accountability. If all actors share the same goal for blended finance \u2013 incentivising the private sector to go where it is desperately needed, to deliver infrastructure or create jobs \u2013 then we ought to be happy with the idea of providing the information to prove it. However we all \u2013 even NGOs \u2013 need to recognise that challenges to delivering transparency (I haven\u2019t covered them all here) need to be addressed. We should commit to overcoming the challenges together, through sharing our collective expertise.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\"></a></p>\n</div><div class=\"row--cards\" ng-if=\"post.notes\">\n<div class=\"col-md-12 card m-b--2\">\n<div class=\"card__content bg--light\">\n<h3 class=\"h3\">Notes</h3>\n<div> <p><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\">[i]</a>\u00a0Blended finance is an emerging term in development finance, generally taken to mean the use of public finance such as aid to de-risk or \u2018leverage\u2019 private resources for development outcomes. Note the argument for increasing transparency in \u2018public-public\u2019 blended finance (blended grants and loans from public institutions) is just as valid; the confusion around definitions of \u2018blended finance\u2019 is in itself a major barrier to transparency, but we haven\u2019t gone into it here.

However,\u00a0<strong>data on refugees</strong>\u00a0\u2013 where they are and how they are doing in relation to socio-economic indicators \u2013 is gathered by the Office of the Prime Minister, the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)</a>\u00a0and other actors operating within a region that perform refugee needs assessments. Data is published as a bi-weekly update on the\u00a0<a href=\"https://ugandarefugees.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Uganda Refugee Response Portal</a>\u00a0by the UNHCR and the Office of the Prime Minister. The needs assessments carried out by other actors are not usually publicly accessible.</p>\n<p>In practice, data on different communities within a region cannot easily be joined up. For those seeking to address development or humanitarian issues, to help improve outcomes for those living in complex communities, there is<strong>\u00a0no single data story that gives a complete picture of the issues that people face</strong>. This means that decisions on how best to address an issue can only ever be a \u2018best guess\u2019, without full knowledge of the potential for knock-on effects \u2013 positive or negative \u2013 on other communities in the area.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not just a question of joining up data \u2013 often data for evidence-based decision-making is simply not available. For example, it\u2019s not possible to track how many refugees provided with land choose to settle in a region, move around the country or go back to their country of origin. This is because refugee communities are often missed from household surveys, censuses are few and far between, and if a refugee becomes homeless they may fall off the data radar altogether.</p>\n<h3><strong>Signs of progress in bridging the divide</strong></h3>\n<p>There are, however, signs of progress in the humanitarian\u2013development nexus. The Ugandan government recognises that\u00a0<strong>humanitarian and development assistance are intertwined</strong>, and this is reflected in the\u00a0<a href=\"http://npa.ug/wp-content/uploads/NDPII-Final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Ugandan National Development Plan</a>\u00a0under the Settlement Transformative Agenda, which develops programmes for the benefit of both refugees and refugee-hosting areas.

What were the trends and what does this mean for current and future funding?", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/humanitarian-funding-what-were-2016s-key-trends/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>Global spending in response to humanitarian crises <a href=\"http://devinit.org/global-humanitarian-assistance-2017\" target=\"_blank\">reached an estimated US$27.3 billion in 2016</a>. Our <em>Global Humanitarian Assistance Report 2017</em> provides detailed and comprehensive analysis of what\u2019s behind this. Here are four key trends in where the money comes from and how and where it is delivered \u2013 and what this means for current and future funding.</p>\n<h4>A slowdown in global humanitarian funding</h4>\n<p>It\u2019s remarkable that in 2016 international humanitarian funding grew for the fourth consecutive year, but striking how this growth slowed. Between 2015 and 2016, <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/development_initiatives/34559896144/\" target=\"_blank\">funding rose by just 6% compared with increases of 12%, 21% and 18% in the previous three years</a>.</p>\n<p>Why this relatively modest rise? It certainly wasn\u2019t driven by a lack of need, if <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/development_initiatives/35235841072/\" target=\"_blank\">last year\u2019s 40% funding shortfall for the UN-coordinated humanitarian appeals</a> is anything to go by, but it may be due to the nature and profile of crises. 2016 was a year of protracted and slower-onset crises \u2013 including ongoing conflicts and the effects of El Ni\u00f1o. Previous years\u2019 increases were associated with major escalations in the Syria crisis and rapid-onset disasters including the Nepal earthquake and the Ebola outbreak.</p>\n<p>Global humanitarian funding is the sum of individual donors\u2019 decisions, and while some gave more in 2016 many levelled off or gave less. Only four of 2015\u2019s ten largest donors of international humanitarian assistance increased their contributions, with Germany showing the largest rise.</p>\n<p>So will 2016 mark the start of a further global funding slowdown? That will depend in part on what crises unfold in the rest of 2017 and on political and economic shifts in donor countries. With almost a third of 2016\u2019s international humanitarian assistance coming from the US, the future looks uncertain.</p>\n<h4>Decreases from the Middle East and a small rise from private donors</h4>\n<p>Looking beyond the major OECD Development Assistance Committee donors, funding from Gulf donors fell in 2016, while that from private donors showed a small rise. This suggests a need for fresh thinking on how to \u201c<a href=\"http://www.agendaforhumanity.org/transformation/69\" target=\"_blank\">increase and diversify the funding base</a>\u201d to fill the humanitarian financing gap.</p>\n<p>Donors in the Middle East had reported a 425% funding rise between 2011 and 2015, prompting hopes that this trend would continue. However, in <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/development_initiatives/34559895874/\" target=\"_blank\">2016 levels fell by 24%</a>, driven by major decreases from Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.</p>\n<p>Private funding (from individuals, trusts and foundations; companies and corporations; and national societies) tends to make up about a quarter of international humanitarian assistance. In 2016 this funding saw an estimated rise of just 6%, compared with an unusually sharp increase of 26% the previous year.</p>\n<h4>Direct funding to local and national responders remained low</h4>\n<p>The mission of the <a href=\"http://www.agendaforhumanity.org/initiatives/3861\" target=\"_blank\">Grand Bargain</a>, agreed at last year\u2019s World Humanitarian Summit, is to make humanitarian financing more effective and efficient. This week, donors and agencies met in Geneva to take stock and agree next steps in implementation. With 52 signatories and 51 commitments, progress has been patchy in this first year.</p>\n<p>Increasing support and funding to local and national responders is one of the most high profile of the Grand Bargain\u2019s ten workstreams. Our analysis shows that <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/development_initiatives/35235841292/\" target=\"_blank\">national and local responders <em>directly</em> received just 2% of funding reported to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs Financial Tracking Service in 2016</a>.</p>\n<p>The Grand Bargain\u2019s localisation commitment came in response to calls for a profound change in the status quo. But while committing to provide 25% of humanitarian assistance to local and national responders \u201cas directly as possible\u201d by 2020 shows a clear intention, it\u2019s raised thorny questions that are still under discussion: what does \u201cas directly as possible\u201d mean, and who counts as a national or local responder?</p>\n<p>Crucially, while counting what these responders received <em>directly</em> is important, we can\u2019t yet know how much they received <em>indirectly,</em> passed through from donors via other organisations. Systematic traceability and an eye on quality and quantity of funding is needed if localisation is to make a meaningful change in the way that humanitarian assistance is implemented.</p>\n<h4>Movement towards a wider set of financing tools to tackle poverty, crisis and risk</h4>\n<p>Last year\u2019s World Humanitarian Summit called for a shift \u201c<a href=\"http://www.agendaforhumanity.org/cr/4\" target=\"_blank\">from delivering aid to ending need</a>\u201d to coherently address poverty, crisis and risk. The <a href=\"http://www.agendaforhumanity.org/initiatives/5358\" target=\"_blank\">New Way of Working</a> aims to bring humanitarian, development and peace-building approaches together, and to be supported by appropriate and well-resourced financing models. While a crisis-shaped blind spot still persists in <a href=\"https://www.devex.com/news/opinion-failing-to-deliver-on-financing-for-development-commitments-90273\" target=\"_blank\">some quarters</a>, 2016 did bring fresh momentum to make the connections.</p>\n<p>In particular, we saw a major drive from the World Bank, with a host of new investments and instruments. Its new <a href=\"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/334721474058771487/World-Bank-Group-global-crisis-response-platform\" target=\"_blank\">Global Crisis Response Platform</a> brings together crisis-related tools including refugee and pandemic financing facilities. Of the record US$75 billion announced in 2016\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2016/12/15/global-community-commitment-end-poverty-ida18\" target=\"_blank\">International Development Association replenishment</a>, almost a fifth will go to addressing fragility, conflict and violence.</p>\n<p>This is important because <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/development_initiatives/34559895464/\" target=\"_blank\">an estimated 87% of all people living in extreme poverty are in countries that are either fragile, environmentally vulnerable or both</a>. While humanitarian grants do play a vital and principled role, they are not the right tool to tackle the underlying risks, causes and long-term consequences of crisis that these \u2018left behind\u2019 populations face. This demands a much fuller toolkit, which we begin to map out in the GHA report \u2013 one which contains everything from insurance to contingency funding and long-term concessional loans.</p>\n<p>Understanding these and other instruments, and tracking how much is going where and how, is crucial for effective, context-specific responses. So, as the minutiae of Grand Bargain commitments are negotiated, those who care about saving and improving lives also need to become adept at watching this bigger picture. We\u2019ll certainly be watching it closely.</p>\n<p>Photo:\u00a0Natalia Tsoukala/ Caritas International, January 2016</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "What are the key trends in DFID\u2019s aid spending o...", "author": [], "format": "Data blog", "date": "15 Jun 2017", "description": "DI has analysed the latest nutrition aid spending by the UK\u2019s Department for International Development (DFID).

This is a very welcome commitment, both setting out practical actions for signatories and playing an important role in tracking other Grand Bargain commitments. All signatories committed to \u201cpublish timely, transparent, harmonized and open high-quality data on humanitarian funding within two years\u201d and to use the <a href=\"http://www.aidtransparency.net/\" target=\"_blank\">International Aid Transparency Initiative</a> (IATI) to do so. Through this commitment to greater transparency, the Grand Bargain sets a clear direction for improving the quality, availability and use of humanitarian data to inform decision-making and improve accountability.</p>\n<p>Greater transparency is now widely accepted as vital to ensure the effectiveness of humanitarian interventions. A lack of reliable, timely data on <em>what</em> resources are used <em>where</em> significantly impacts the ability of donors, governments and responding agencies to plan and implement effective responses to crises. It is clear from both the aftermath of the 2015 earthquake in Nepal and the Ebola outbreak in 2014 to 2016 that <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/betterinformation/\" target=\"_blank\">access to reliable, timely data on resources would have enabled better coordination</a> among humanitarian actors, resulting in a more effective response. Furthermore, better reporting and sharing of information is needed to track progress on commitments made in other Grand Bargain areas \u2013 by enabling greater visibility of funding to national and local actors, for example, or tracking spending through cash programming \u2013 and to hold the signatories to account.</p>\n<p>We\u2019re now a year on from the signing of the Grand Bargain and progress is being made; donors and aid organisations are taking steps towards meeting their commitments to improve transparency. Our baseline report \u2013 <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/baseline-report-implementing-and-monitoring-the-grand-bargain-commitment-on-transparency\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Implementing and monitoring the Grand Bargain commitment on transparency</em></a> \u2013 finds that 73% of signatories are currently publishing data to the IATI Standard, and 61% are already publishing humanitarian aid data. While the report highlights challenges that some actors face in publishing to IATI, the overall picture is a positive one that suggests that organisations are recognising the benefits of better humanitarian data.</p>\n<p>However, no matter what progress has been made, we must remember that, while it is a critical first step, making more data available does not automatically translate to better decision-making or more effective responses to humanitarian crises. The data that is produced must be used if it is to be useful \u2013 it must be turned into information, and used as evidence to inform and influence decisions about future humanitarian responses, ongoing resilience building and development work. It should also be used for improved accountability. Donors must be able to better explain to their citizens how and where their funds are being spent, their impact, and where the gaps lie. People affected by crises should be able to use the data to better understand, and influence, the resources that are made available to them.</p>\n<p>While commitments to greater transparency and progress in this area should be commended and continued, investments must also be made to encourage and support the use of data, which will ultimately determine a better humanitarian response for affected populations.</p>\n<p>Read our report <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/baseline-report-implementing-and-monitoring-the-grand-bargain-commitment-on-transparency\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Implementing and monitoring the Grand Bargain commitment on transparency</em></a></p>\n<p>For more on humanitarian financing, look out for the upcoming Global Humanitarian Assistance Report 2017, which will be published on this site on Wednesday 21 June 2017.</p>\n<p class=\" meta-field photo-desc \">Photo: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/dfid/30799032656/in/photolist-NEMXDn-NVB6oq-PuyAP3-PuyASj-PuyAXu-P9KHMN-PuyAW7-P9KHT9-Px9rtt-PuyB2s-PQWfhS-NEMXJ2-PpFX95-PHECLD\">International Organisation for Migration / IOM Iraq</a></p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Failing to deliver on Financing for Development co...", "author": ["Sarah Dalrymple"], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "01 Jun 2017", "description": "To succeed in fostering greater coherence of development and humanitarian outcomes, buy-in from both humanitarian and development actors is critical.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/failing-to-deliver-on-financing-for-development-commitments/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"><p>This article originally appeared in <a class=\"js-track-clicks\" href=\"https://www.devex.com/news/opinion-failing-to-deliver-on-financing-for-development-commitments-90273\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Devex</strong></a>, the media platform for the global development community.</p>\n</div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>Most humanitarian crises are protracted or recurrent and the majority of humanitarian assistance is provided year-on-year over the medium to long term: 91 percent of humanitarian assistance from the <a class=\"c6\" href=\"https://www.devex.com/organizations/organisation-for-economic-co-operation-and-development-oecd-29872\" target=\"_blank\">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development</a>\u00a0Development Assistance Committee donors went to long- and medium-term recipients in 2014 (the year for which data is most recently available).</p>\n<p>As a result, there is a strong rationale for longer term humanitarian planning and financing, and greater coordination between humanitarian and development actors working in the same protracted crisis contexts to more effectively address the needs of vulnerable people and \u2018leave no one behind\u2019.</p>\n<p>In line with this, a number of recent global processes \u2014 including the <a class=\"c6\" href=\"http://www.un.org/esa/ffd/ffd3/\" target=\"_blank\">Third International Financing conference on Financing for Development</a>\u00a0(2015), <a class=\"c6\" href=\"https://www.worldhumanitariansummit.org/\" target=\"_blank\">World Humanitarian Summit (2016)</a>\u00a0and <a class=\"c6\" href=\"http://reliefweb.int/report/world/high-level-panel-humanitarian-financing-report-secretary-general-too-important-fail\" target=\"_blank\">U.N. High Level Panel on Humanitarian Financing</a>\u00a0\u2014 have resulted in promising commitments to strengthen the coherence of humanitarian and development responses and financing. This recognizes the role that development finance plays in crisis prevention, risk management and addressing people\u2019s vulnerabilities in protracted or \u2018chronic\u2019 crises.</p>\n<h3>The importance of the financing for development process</h3>\n<p>To succeed in fostering greater coherence of development and humanitarian outcomes, buy-in from both humanitarian and development actors is critical. The commitments resulting from the Third International Conference on FFD (as outlined in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda) are particularly important in promoting this agenda. This is because the AAAA represents a rare intergovernmental commitment by development actors to promote coherence between development and humanitarian outcomes and financing. This meets a need recognized by the humanitarian community for some time. FFD is also the only intergovernmental financing agreement governing the delivery of the 2030 Agenda \u2014 the main framework for sustainable development in the post-2015 era.</p>\n<p>Commitments to transform rhetoric on development-humanitarian coherence into action in the AAAA include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Development-humanitarian coherence:</strong>\u00a0Recognizes the need for the coherence of developmental and humanitarian finance to ensure timelier, comprehensive, appropriate and cost-effective approaches to the management and mitigation of natural disasters and complex emergencies.</li>\n<li><strong>Role of development finance in crisis prevention and risk management:</strong>\u00a0Commits to promoting innovative financing mechanisms to allow countries to better prevent and manage risks and develop mitigation plans.</li>\n<li><strong>Funding to local and national actors:</strong>\u00a0Commits to investment in efforts to strengthen the capacity of national and local actors to manage and finance disaster risk reduction.</li>\n<li><strong>Support to livelihoods of refugees:</strong>\u00a0Recognizes the importance of delivering quality education to all girls and boys and reaching children living in extreme poverty, children with disabilities, migrant and refugee children, and those in conflict and post-conflict situations.</li>\n<li><strong>Support for financing on peacebuilding:</strong>\u00a0Recognizes the peacebuilding financing gap and the role played by the Peacebuilding Fund, and commits to step up efforts to assist countries in accessing financing for peacebuilding and development in the post-conflict context.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Failure to deliver on commitments made?</h3>\n<p>Yet despite the progress made in 2015, the draft report of the <a class=\"c6\" href=\"http://www.un.org/esa/ffd/publications/advance-unedited-draft-of-2017-iatf-report.html\" target=\"_blank\">Inter-Agency Task Force on FFD</a>\u00a0from April 2017 and inter-governmental outcome document for the <a class=\"c6\" href=\"http://www.un.org/esa/ffd/ffdforum/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/05/E-FFDF-2017-L.1_Draft-Outcome.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2017 ECOSOC Forum on Financing for Development</a>\u00a0that was adopted by member states fail to deliver on these commitments and, as such, have fallen at the first hurdle.</p>\n<p>The complete absence of references to these commitments in the draft report of the IATF and in ECOSOC Forum on FFD outcome document signify the deprioritization of this agenda in the FFD process going forward. This threatens to undermine the progress of other processes working toward collective outcomes, such as the delivery of Grand Bargain Commitment 10, \u201cto enhance engagement between humanitarian and development actors,\u201d which emerged as an outcome of the U.N. High Level Panel on Humanitarian Financing.</p>\n<p>Not only are references to these commitments absent, but the IAFT report appears to take a backward step in this area. The report states that: \u201callocating more development finance to emergency responses must not divert resources from long-term investments in sustainable development. Development cooperation providers should commit to protect and increase concessional development financing net of humanitarian financing and spending on refugees.\u201d</p>\n<p>While this sentiment responds to ongoing concerns around the diversion of aid, it lacks recognition of the need for greater coherence between development and humanitarian outcomes \u2014 as is critical to effectively meet the needs of vulnerable people and deliver on the Sustainable Development Goals in protracted crisis situations.</p>\n<h3>So what next?</h3>\n<p>It is vital that both development and humanitarian actors deliver on their existing commitments.</p>\n<p>As a first step, it is important that future reports of the IATF and outcome documents for the 2018 and subsequent ECOSOC Forum on Financing for Development reaffirm recognition of the need for coherence between development and humanitarian actors, and reiterate commitments to finance crisis prevention, risk management, peacebuilding, and the capacities of local and national actors to respond to disasters.</p>\n<p>For this to happen, it is important that actors involved in the delivery of the AAAA coordinate with those leading on the Grand Bargain Commitment 10 and other relevant financing initiatives emerging from the World Humanitarian Summit. These actors must then better engage in the FFD process to deliver on the AAAA commitments for the achievement of collective outcomes.</p>\n<p>While it is easy to make policy commitments on development-humanitarian coherence and collective outcomes, delivery is the real challenge. Responding to the needs of refugees in protracted crises, providing support to peacebuilding and conflict prevention, and building capacities for risk management and disaster prevention offer real opportunities for the FFD process to work with others in the humanitarian sector to transform principles into practice.</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Making the case for disaggregated data: A look at ...", "author": ["Cat Langdon"], "format": "Data blog", "date": "24 May 2017", "description": "Cat Langdon takes a look at disaggregated data on Ethiopia, and examines how it can be used and improved to help us track the needs of the poorest people.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/making-the-case-for-disaggregated-data-a-look-at-ethiopia/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development lays out an ambitious vision of a future where no one lives in extreme poverty. At the heart of the Sustainable Development Goals is a commitment to ensure that \u2018no one is left behind\u2019 and that no goal is considered met unless met for all. But if we are to truly realise this ambition we need to move beyond existing statistics that track national averages and move towards more and better data disaggregated down to the level of individuals. In other words, we need to count people, not averages.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://devinit.org/p20i/\" target=\"_blank\">P20 Initiative</a> does this by focusing on the people who live in the poorest 20% of the population globally: the P20. The initiative tracks progress of people out of poverty using the best available data. It makes the case for greater investment in the production and use of disaggregated data so that policies and resources can be accurately targeted towards those who are currently being left behind.</p>\n<p>The need for disaggregated data is clear. National data masks disparities at the subnational, community and household levels The <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2rAgViB\" target=\"_blank\">new global map</a> visualisation on our Development Data Hub illustrates the problem.

This is in stark contrast to predominately urban regions such as Dire Dawa and Harari where the percentage of those in the global P20 falls to 12% and 19%, respectively.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Making-the-case-for-disaggregated-data-Fig-2.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-12837\" height=\"557\" sizes=\"(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Making-the-case-for-disaggregated-data-Fig-2.png\" srcset=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Making-the-case-for-disaggregated-data-Fig-2.png 675w, http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Making-the-case-for-disaggregated-data-Fig-2-120x100.png 120w\" width=\"675\"/></a></p>\n<p>The picture becomes even more granular when we look <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2rzB6gE\" target=\"_blank\">at the survey level</a>, where each dot on the map represents a cluster of surveyed households. In the Harari region we can see large disparities between survey clusters, with some reporting up to 72% of residents among the global P20, and some reporting 0%. What also becomes clear at the survey level is that the distribution of household survey clusters is uneven across the country. Survey clusters are much denser in urban areas, reflecting both higher population density and ease of access for survey enumerators. By contrast, there are no survey clusters in some of the more remote and sparsely populated areas of the country, and in the absence of data it is impossible to know if they contain households or individuals who are being left behind.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Making-the-case-for-disaggregated-data-Fig-3.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-12838\" height=\"559\" sizes=\"(max-width: 674px) 100vw, 674px\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Making-the-case-for-disaggregated-data-Fig-3.png\" srcset=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Making-the-case-for-disaggregated-data-Fig-3.png 674w, http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Making-the-case-for-disaggregated-data-Fig-3-120x100.png 120w\" width=\"674\"/></a></p>\n<p>This global visualisation clearly illustrates the disparities that are masked if we only look at national averages as indicators of progress.

This article details the resilience of the Kenyan state versus these hazards.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/how-prepared-for-disasters-is-kenya/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>Kenya is a nation prone to conflicts, slow-onset natural disasters such as droughts and famine, and rapid-onset disasters such as floods, land or mudslides, and disease outbreaks. Its topography makes areas of the country particularly susceptible to natural disasters, with arid and semi-arid lands covering about 89% of the total land mass \u2013 home to about 36% of the population. Subnationally there are areas that are regularly affected by droughts, resulting in food insecurity, high levels of malnutrition-related illnesses and deaths, and disruption of livelihoods. Other areas with poor surface water drainage are prone to flooding, resulting in loss of life and property, and outbreaks of waterborne human and animal diseases such as cholera and Rift Valley fever.</p>\n<p>It is vital that Kenya is prepared to face these challenges to minimise the impact of disasters on people and livelihoods. While resource allocations for disaster preparedness are increasing, <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/assessment-of-kenyas-preparedness-to-disasters-caused-by-natural-hazards-floods-drought-and-disease-outbreak/\" target=\"_blank\">the culture of preparedness in Kenya is lacking</a>. There is no legal framework and no clear coordination across different types of disaster or across actors.</p>\n<p>Importantly,\u00a0there are key things that Kenya is getting right. Links exist between Kenya\u2019s preparedness and international processes: the country has participated in both the <a href=\"https://www.unisdr.org/we/coordinate/hfa\" target=\"_blank\">Hyogo Framework for Action</a> and <a href=\"http://www.unisdr.org/we/coordinate/sendai-framework\" target=\"_blank\">Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction</a>. Furthermore, Kenya contributes the highest annual premium among African countries (US$9\u00a0million/KES\u00a0900 million) to the <a href=\"http://www.africanriskcapacity.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Africa Risk Capacity</a> (ARC) \u2013 an insurance scheme that covers against the financial impacts of drought.\u00a0This shows a level of commitment by the Kenyan government to undertake preparedness activities, and it should be considered an excellent starting point from which to build. In fact, Kenya\u2019s preparedness for drought appears to be far better coordinated than the country\u2019s preparedness for flood or disease, and there are lessons to be learnt from it.</p>\n<p>Strengths can also be seen at the subnational level, where examples of community preparedness exist. In Mandera the Community Management Disaster Risk Reduction- CMDRR process (a participatory process of disaster risk assessment, planning and implementation) enables beneficiaries to inform preparedness processes, and in Migori County, communities have organised themselves to build resilience. They have done this through \u2018community disaster champions\u2019 (individuals who are supported by implementing agencies to train the community on disaster preparedness and response), flood management committees, disaster drills, community awareness meetings and self-help groups run by women. Gender inclusion and participation is another strength at this level.</p>\n<p>It is clear, however, that other areas must be improved for disaster-prone Kenya to be well prepared. An important starting point would be to foster greater collaboration between the various actors working on preparedness. In a country with a broad range of risks faced by different people and at different times, there is a need to join up approaches and ensure shared earnings between actors. A multistakeholder approach that includes representatives from human and animal health, academia, beneficiaries and the media should also be adopted to promote the draft disaster risk management law, pushing for disaster preparedness to be enshrined in legislation.</p>\n<p>Developing standard operating procedures for multiple types of disasters is another crucial step that should be prioritised by the Kenyan government. Working together with implementing agencies, this will ensure that no matter what the hazard or the location, all people will benefit from the same levels of preparation. Once developed, these procedures should be updated regularly to reflect key learning and changes to the internal and external environment.</p>\n<p>At county level, improvements such as better subnational budget allocation and timely disbursement will ensure better preparedness and a stronger response. County government officials will also benefit from knowledge strengthening on disaster and resilience measurement, climate change dynamics and modelling, and disaster response triggers and thresholds.</p>\n<p>While there are signs of commitment, further work is required to ensure Kenya is prepared for disasters to minimise their impact on people. International, national and subnational actors have a role to play, and they must now come together to generate the culture of preparedness that is so needed in Kenya.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/assessment-of-kenyas-preparedness-to-disasters-caused-by-natural-hazards-floods-drought-and-disease-outbreak/\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full report on Kenya\u2019s preparedness to disasters caused by natural hazards</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Assessment-of-Kenyas-preparedness-to-disasters-caused-by-natural-hazards-briefing.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Download our briefing</a></p>\n<p class=\" meta-field photo-desc \" id=\"yui_3_16_0_1_1492763114663_1964\"><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/climatecentre/32987984414/in/photostream/\" target=\"_blank\">Photo: Alex Wynter/KRCS-Climate Centre</a></p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Nepal\u2019s emerging data revolution for sustainable...", "author": ["Louisa Dennison"], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "04 Apr 2017", "description": "The past few years have seen a growing focus on data as a key driver of sustainable development.

Internationally, the data revolution has emerged as a key paradigm encapsulating the transformational change needed in the production, sharing and use of data to drive and monitor sustainable development.</p>\n</div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>At a national level these changes are unfolding differently, according to particular local contexts \u2013 for example those involving multiple stakeholders with diverse interests, and comprising different initiatives and milestones according to local priorities, challenges and opportunities. Since 2011 we have worked in collaboration with various partners to improve the production, sharing and use of data for sustainable development in Nepal. In our background paper <em><a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/insights-into-nepals-emerging-data-revolution/\" target=\"_blank\">Nepal\u2019s emerging data revolution</a>,</em> we share insights into the context in which the data revolution is materialising alongside key milestones and stakeholders involved.</p>\n<p>In Nepal, while there is still a long way to go before access and use of development data are widespread, interest in the role of data in development planning, monitoring, decision-making, governance and accountability is growing, and important advances have been made over the past five years. Nepal\u2019s nascent and dynamic community of data enthusiasts has played an important role in this progress, supporting advancements in digital data collection, the opening of official datasets, and the development of data-sharing and e-governance platforms. It has encouraged growing interest from government and civil society in the agenda for better production, sharing and use of data, whether that agenda is termed \u2018open development\u2019, \u2018open data\u2019, \u2018access to information\u2019, \u2018evidence for development\u2019 or brought together under the broader umbrella of \u2018the data revolution for sustainable development\u2019, as in our background paper. If supported with the right funding and opportunities for learning and skills development, diverse actors across this community can continue to make a significant contribution to the data revolution. Areas in which they can be supported to make an important contribution include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Increasing demand and building political will for data production, sharing and use. </strong>In this area, the community has demonstrated leadership in raising awareness and engaging public sector champions in open data efforts. The key to future advances is demonstrating to producers and potential users the value of data, focusing on the impact that its use can have on specific development issues. These efforts need to be informed by a detailed understanding of the current behaviours of decision-making and accountability actors; a clear view of the challenges faced in producing, sharing and using data; and a better understanding of the incentives and disincentives to data use.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Improving the production and systematic sharing of high-quality data.</strong> The community has made important contributions through the development of various data-sharing platforms. The key to future work is developing a systematic understanding of the data needed by national and local actors to facilitate evidence-based decision-making and accountability; identifying what data is available; and diagnosing the gaps in data production and sharing. The involvement of data users in the design of initiatives to improve data production and sharing can help ensure that their needs are addressed.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Supporting the use of data for development decision-making and accountability, and building a culture of data use.</strong> Nepal\u2019s community of data enthusiasts has demonstrated initial success through a series of pilot interventions. Going forward, their role in this area is critical and should build on a strong understanding of the challenges preventing national and local actors using data in their efforts. A suite of practical interventions can then be developed to address these barriers, for example training programmes to build data skills, open-source tools to support analysis and its application, the provision of technical infrastructure to support data access, and the design of incentive structures to reward data use. In addition, the use of new, non-traditional types of data can be trialled, for example big data and citizen-generated data, and the capacity of intermediaries such as journalists can be built to better facilitate the translation of data into information for the wider population.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Over the past five years, Development Initiatives, through involvement with the <a href=\"http://opennepal.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Open Nepal</a> initiative, has had the privilege of engaging with many of these actors and in many of these developments. We have learned from their insights and experiences, and have witnessed, alongside them, the emergence of Nepal\u2019s data revolution. In our background paper we share some of our observations on the present state of production, sharing and use of data for sustainable development in Nepal, alongside details of the country context and key stakeholders. We hope this will help inform the work of practitioners and supporters, and that the recommendations will support the future work of Nepal\u2019s data community.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/insights-into-nepals-emerging-data-revolution/\" target=\"_blank\">View the report here.</a></p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "What are the principles of joined-up data?", "author": [], "format": "Innovation blogs", "date": "31 Mar 2017", "description": "This post defines what 'joined-up' data is, putting forward five core interoperability principles.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/what-are-the-principles-of-joined-up-data/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"><p>This blog originally appeared on <a href=\"http://opendatawatch.com/blog/what-are-the-principles-of-joined-up-data/\" target=\"_blank\">Open Data Watch</a>.

He asked: \u201cThe definition and principles of \u2018open data\u2019 are quite clear and simple but the principles of joined-up data are less clear. Can you enunciate five principles of joined-up data that could serve as a practical guide for others?\u201d</p>\n<p>This is a question that we at the <a href=\"http://juds.joinedupdata.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Joined-Up Data Standards (JUDS) project</a> have been beginning to answer through our discussion papers, blogs and consultation paper. That said, Eric touched on a real gap in terms of concrete guidance when it comes to a commonly recognised list of principles for interoperability \u2013 the ability to access and process data from multiple sources without losing meaning, and integrate them for mapping, visualisation, and other forms of analysis \u2013 at a global level.</p>\n<p>This blog builds on the answer that I gave to the Friday seminar and sets out five core interoperability principles:</p>\n<p><strong>Principle 1: Use and reuse existing data standards</strong><br/>\nPerhaps the most basic principle that underpins joined-up data is the notion that new classifications \u2013 how data are described \u2013 and standards \u2013 schema into which data are input \u2013 should not be developed unless absolutely necessary. Where possible, those seeking to develop a new standard should spend time considering what is already out there and whether an open data standard already exists that can simply and easily be adapted to their needs. This principle is implicitly recognised within our <a href=\"http://juds.joinedupdata.org/a-consultation-on-joined-up-data-standards/\" target=\"_blank\">consultation paper</a>, where we suggest a \u2018checklist for new data standards\u2019 as a guide for anyone seeking to produce a new data standard. Moreover, any new standard developed must be compatible with existing standards.</p>\n<p><strong>Principle 2: Don\u2019t forget metadata</strong><br/>\nMetadata standards are arguably the most important prerequisite to joined-up data. Metadata includes information on the source of a piece of data, its author, the version being published and the link to the original dataset. Taken together, this information is crucial to ensuring that both machine and human users can discover, identify and contextualise data. Ensuring that machine-readable metadata formats are standardised and used across data producing institutions and bodies therefore greatly enhances the ability of data to be joined-up.</p>\n<p>These attributes make metadata particularly important for the official statistics community as it starts to consider how statistical data can be made open by default. As my colleague Beata Lisowska recently put it in another <a href=\"https://www.devex.com/news/opinion-the-case-for-metadata-89719?utm_content=buffer67d16&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer\" target=\"_blank\">blog</a>, when it comes to metadata, \u201cin essence, we\u2019re really asking: can we trust this data?\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Principle 3: Use common classifications wherever possible</strong><br/>\nAs more and more data are made open and proactively published by governments, international institutions, private sector actors, open standard initiatives and others, we need to make sure that the language used \u2013 or the classifications to which data are published \u2013 is the same. Often, similar information is classified using slightly different definitions, which hinders the machine-readability and so interoperability of that data. Within the international development sector, it\u2019s crucial that data standards are fit for purpose and actively used, or at least linked to, by all stakeholders producing data.</p>\n<p>Classifications of organisations and time formats are two cases in point where the absence of universally agreed definitions can seriously inhibit broad-scale interoperability. The <a href=\"http://identify-org.net/\" target=\"_blank\">identify-org.net</a> site succinctly explains why the issue of organisational identifiers is important: \u201cIf my dataset tells you I have contacts with \u2018IBM Ltd\u2019. \u2018International Business Machines\u2019 and \u2018I.B.M\u2019 \u2013 how many firms am I working with?\u201d Unique identifiers would go a long way to overcoming basic semantic challenges like this.</p>\n<p>The United Nations Statistics Division has published a registry of classifications that it maintains at <a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/default.asp?Lg=1\" target=\"_blank\">UN Classifications Registry</a>. However the list does not include other international classifications such as UNESCO\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.uis.unesco.org/Education/Documents/isced-2011-en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">International Classification of Education (ISCED)</a>, WHO\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/\" target=\"_blank\">International Classification of Disease</a>, or many other important classifications. A comprehensive inventory of all international and relevant national classification systems would be a boon to interoperability.</p>\n<p><strong>Principle 4: Publish data in machine-readable formats</strong><br/>\nFor joined-up data solutions to offer real efficiency gains and value, it\u2019s imperative that a machine is able to do most of the hard work in joining up the data. This is already possible but requires many data publishers to change the way they currently publish their data. Publishing data only in PDF format is not enough; data must also be published in machine-readable formats such as RDF, XML and JSON. Publishing in these formats would enable a computer to access, identify and filter data in an automated way, making it far simpler and less time-consuming for data users to put data to good use.</p>\n<p><strong>Principle 5: Ensure standards are user-driven</strong><br/>\nThe explosion in open data publication that has taken place over the last twenty-odd years has happened with the key consideration of \u2018openness\u2019 at its heart. Whilst this is great and important, openness does not automatically equate to usability. For data to be usable they must be driven by the needs of users themselves. Take the <a href=\"http://hxlstandard.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Humanitarian eXchange Language (HXL) standard</a> for example. Its beauty and functionality emanate from its incredible simplicity and ease of use. The process of ensuring that an interoperable standard is \u2018usable\u2019 can be a complex one that requires trial and error. Sticking with the HXL example, a linked-data approach was tried and tested but failed given the complexity of user needs in the humanitarian space. A hashtag approach was later agreed, which put user-needs at the heart of the endeavour [1].</p>\n<p>These are some of the core principles of interoperability that we\u2019ve uncovered during our research. They offer a starting point for further discussion and we will continue to explore these issues and others with the various stakeholders involved. One thing that we can be sure of already is that to find solutions to interoperability challenges, political will and policy coordination between governments, international organisations, open standard setters and others is key.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Tom Orrell is the Senior Advocacy Adviser on Joined-up Data Standards, based at Publish What You Fund\u2019s London office.

Since then, technological advances have supported increased access to data and information through initiatives such as open-data platforms and SMS-based citizen reporting systems. The main ambition for these advances is to produce data that decision-makers find timely and usable. Proponents of citizen-generated data assert its potential to achieve these aims in the context of the sustainable development agenda.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, there is a need for more evidence on the potential of citizen-generated data to influence policy and service delivery, and to contribute to the achievement of the sustainable development goals.

Resource Trackers identify and track community resources (including both financial and in-kind allocations made through central and local government, NGOs and donors) and provide feedback to duty bearers and service providers on the delivery of projects.</p>\n<p>In Kenya we focused on a formalised process of citizen-generated data involving the Ministry of Education and National Taxpayers Association. It studies the School Report Card \u2013 an effort to increase parent involvement in schooling. The School Report Card is a yearly scorecard for parents to assess the performance of their school in ten areas that relate to education quality.</p>\n<h3>What were the findings?</h3>\n<p>The processes provided insight that demonstrated how citizen-generated data had influenced accountability, resource allocation, service delivery and the governments\u2019 responses to such data initiatives.</p>\n<p>Both cases demonstrated the relevance of citizen-generated data in improving service delivery. They showed that the uptake of citizen-generated data and response by government depended significantly on, firstly, the quality of relationship that citizen-generated data producers create with government, and secondly, the degree to which the initiatives relate to existing policy priorities and government interests.</p>\n<p>The study also revealed important effects on the behaviour of citizens participating in citizen-generated data processes \u2013 they understood their role and participated more in development processes with better skills, knowledge and confidence due to the citizen-generated data projects.</p>\n<p>The Kenya case study also revealed that citizen-generated data could influence policy if the data is generated and used at a large geographical scale and directly linked to a specific sector; however, this is difficult to measure. In Uganda we observed distinct improvements in service delivery and accessibility at the local level \u2013 which was the citizens\u2019 motivation for engaging in citizen-generated data in the first instance.</p>\n<h3>Could citizen-generated data be used to measure Global Goals?</h3>\n<p>Official data sources-data produced by governments- may not deliver timely information for decision-making, and citizen-generated data can fill existing data gaps. This is especially true at community and local-government levels, where data can support decision-making. At the national level, citizen-generated data could potentially play a role as a monitoring tool in the sustainable development framework, qualitatively identifying and explaining SDG achievements at the micro-level.</p>\n<p>Despite the positive indications that citizen-generated data plays a role in improving service delivery and could be used to monitor the SDGs, there are still doubts about citizen-generated data. Among these is the hesitation of official data stakeholders to acknowledge (1) that it is proper for non-official actors to contribute data on development issues, or (2) that the data itself is authoritative. The limited representativeness, standardisation and quality assurance of citizen-generated data are also recurring points of concern for policy actors, and the \u2018politics\u2019 of the data arena adds to this. How then do proponents of citizen-generated data build acceptance for it, especially within official circles?</p>\n<p>Based on the finding that citizen-generated data has significant potential to complement official data, and recognising that even within official-data circles, challenges persist that reduce the volume of the timely, disaggregated data required to ensure that no one is left behind, official and non-official data producers and users need to increase collaboration. To augment this, concerns such as those regarding the quality, capacity and sustainability of citizen-generated data should be addressed. This in turn should help bring about official recognition for the data.</p>\n<p>The study finds that there is scope for research to help realise citizen-generated data\u2019s potential in specific contexts. This includes: further research to develop typologies and case studies of citizen-generated data initiatives, the data they produce and the data gaps they fill. Ongoing dialogue between official and non-official data stakeholders should contribute to development of an inclusive national statistics system that maximises the contributions of all data actors.</p>\n<p><em>Ssanyu Rebecca has over fourteen years\u2019 experience in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of development programs, as well as social policy and research.

While making improvements in each of these areas is absolutely necessary, there is a pressing need to take the revolution further by going beyond the data itself. We need to see the data revolution extend to cover a revolution in the information that sits behind data \u2014\u00a0the what, the how, the who and the when \u2014\u00a0because this revolution would make planning and monitoring spending on the SDGs a far more manageable task.</p>\n<p>Take the example of SDG 4 \u2014\u00a0quality education \u2014\u00a0in Kenya. To understand what resources are being targeted at meeting this goal, we need to analyze and compare data from a number of sources. This would include the Kenyan government\u2019s current budget data and data on its future spending plans. We would also want to look at donor data reported through international systems, and perhaps the indicators produced by the national statistics office. But before we get started on comparing corresponding datasets we need to ask a series of questions: When was this dataset published? Who published it? How was the data gathered? What does this dataset contain?</p>\n<p>In essence, we\u2019re really asking: Can we trust this data?</p>\n<p>In some cases the answers to these questions are out there, but if they are, too often they require patience, perseverance and manual intervention to find. Imagine then how much easier it would be if each dataset were equipped with this information and more. And imagine how much we could learn if that information was hyperlinked to show us where to find other related datasets.</p>\n<p>The information we\u2019re talking about here is metadata. Like the information that\u2019s held about a publication in a library catalogue \u2014\u00a0information about the title of a book, the author, the date of publication, the ISBN number \u2014\u00a0metadata associated with datasets tells us critical information about the provenance of the data we\u2019re looking at. In doing so, metadata helps us to establish whether or not we can trust that data. And this question of trust is particularly important as more and more data is published openly. We can access data about so many topics, sectors and people, but do we know where it originated, how current it is or when it will next be updated?</p>\n<p>Very often the answer to these questions is no, because the metadata that accompanies an open dataset is either patchy or missing altogether. Data publishers are not yet consistently publishing the metadata that is required to establish the origins of the data they\u2019re sharing.</p>\n<p>Beyond the question of trust, this lack of metadata becomes problematic when we are trying to make sense of a dataset, compare it with another or discover other related datasets. How can we track \u2014\u00a0for example, progress over time \u2014 or understand how data about one location compares to data about the same location from a different source, if we\u2019re not equipped with basic information about the data we\u2019re looking at?</p>\n<p>These are vital comparisons if we are to see evidence-led decisions being made about how best to meet the SDGs, or to track our progress toward meeting them, especially if using datasets from various sources.</p>\n<p>Importantly, metadata is not only useful for describing datasets and establishing trust. Metadata can also help build links between datasets, to highlight where a newly published version of the data is held, or to direct us to historical data that would help to build a baseline. The benefit of including pointers to other related datasets within metadata would the generation of a network of linked datasets, which in turn would enable searches of multiple datasets through a single query. This would be invaluable in performing analyses such as the Kenya example above.</p>\n<p>With the benefits of publishing metadata being so clear, it is crucial that within the data revolution a metadata revolution also takes place. As a minimum, data producers should be attaching metadata to all the data that they publish, and the W3C\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/\" target=\"_blank\">Data on the Web Best Practices</a>\u00a0provides a good starting point. To derive the maximum benefit from publishing this metadata though, data producers should go a step further: They should publish metadata to the same standard or, at least, should seek interoperable solutions to ensure that the data they are publishing becomes easily discoverable to any potential data users across platforms.</p>\n<p>The technology to do all this already exists;\u00a0<a href=\"http://juds.joinedupdata.org/discussion-papers/paper-6-open-metadata-portals/#_Toc469561932\" target=\"_blank\">metadata standards</a>\u00a0have been around for a while. So it\u2019s now a case of will \u2014\u00a0the will of data producers to publish metadata to make sure that their data can be found, trusted and used in evidence-led decision-making.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/oddwick/4775001075/\" target=\"_blank\">Image credit: Todd Huffman</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Helping the International Aid Transparency Initiat...", "author": ["Conrad Zellmann", "Wilbrod Ntawiha"], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "07 Mar 2017", "description": "This report, assesses how data published under IATI has been used, and what is needed from our community to ensure more people benefit from this initiative.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/helping-the-international-aid-transparency-initiative-iati-reach-its-potential/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"><p>Development Initiatives\u2019 new report on IATI data use sets the scene for TAG 2017</p>\n</div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>This week, we\u2019re representing IATI \u2013 an initiative making information about aid spending easier to access, use and understand \u2013 at\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.aidtransparency.net/technicaladvisorygroup/tag-meetings/tag-meeting-2017\" target=\"_blank\">TAG 2017</a>. This is the flagship event for IATI\u2019s global technical community committed to improving transparency and open data in development.</p>\n<p>To date, IATI has attracted more than 500 publishers, who are sharing information about transactions that last year alone totalled US$146 billion (<a href=\"http://www.aidtransparency.net/news/annual-report-2016-146-billion-of-development-spending-reported-to-iati\" target=\"_blank\">see the 2016 annual report</a>). It\u2019s essential that the valuable information reported to the IATI standard is now used to improve the effectiveness of these resources through enhanced decision making, transparency and accountability.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s why Development Initiatives has launched its new report \u2018<a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/reaching-the-potential-a-review-of-iati-data-use-and-ways-to-increase-it/\" target=\"_blank\">Reaching the potential of IATI data</a>\u2019, which we hope will add value to discussions at the TAG. In the report, we assess how data published to the standard since its inception in 2011 has been used, and what is now needed from our community to ensure more people benefit from this initiative.</p>\n<p><strong>Why use IATI data? </strong></p>\n<p>It\u2019s vital that we are clear on the potential benefits that the data can bring for a wide range of actors, from developing-country governments to citizens. Our report identifies three key examples:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Increasing transparency</strong> through the application of a common and open reporting standard to enable access to and use of comprehensive, comparable, timely and forward-looking data on financial resource flows.</li>\n<li><strong>Increasing efficiency and effectiveness</strong> through the use of IATI data in planning, coordinating and mobilising resources for better development interventions.</li>\n<li><strong>Increasing accountability</strong> through the use of IATI data by a range of official and non-official actors to monitor delivery, detect corruption and advocate for improvements.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Who\u2019s making the most use of IATI data now? </strong></p>\n<p>Surprisingly, it\u2019s donors. IATI was originally established with the aim of meeting the demand from developing-country governments for timely, comprehensive and forward-looking information on external resources. Currently, however, the most evident use of this data by far is in information portals set up by donors and development partners. Due to their focus on (mostly) individual providers, these efforts primarily serve to demonstrate transparency and accountability to a domestic or international audience.</p>\n<p>Our report lists 12 such portals currently operating; they span major bilateral aid providers as well as multilateral actors.</p>\n<p><strong>Are developing countries using IATI? </strong></p>\n<p><em>Local aid-management systems</em></p>\n<p>Using the data for decision-making processes crucially depends on the level of integration of IATI with local AIMS (aid information management systems). Work has been undertaken to import IATI data into AIMS in <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/BD-IATI-AIMS\" target=\"_blank\">Bangladesh</a>, <a href=\"http://www.aidtransparency.net/about/partner-country-perspectives/iatiundp-regional-workshop-on-data-usage-accra-ghana\" target=\"_blank\">Rwanda</a>, <a href=\"http://www.developmentgateway.org/assets/post-resources/IATI-JuneSCMeetings-FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Chad, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Madagascar and Senegal</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Full picture of resources </em></p>\n<p>Some governments are regularly using IATI data to check and/or complement their own data. For example, in Liberia the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning <a href=\"http://www.aidtransparency.net/news/using-iati-data-60-second-interview-with-liberian-government\" target=\"_blank\">reported using IATI data</a> to monitor flow of external resources in the context of the Ebola crisis.</p>\n<p><em>Accountability</em></p>\n<p>Evidence for the use of IATI-based information to hold development resource providers and implementers to account is perhaps the most limited use to date. An example of such a use involved efforts to monitor implementation of DFID-funded NGO projects by the <a href=\"http://integrityaction.org/sites/default/files/publication/files/Publication_NTA%20Integrity%20Action%20Aid%20Transaprency%20Pilot%20Project.pdf\">National Taxpayers Association together with Integrity Action</a> in Kenya.</p>\n<p><strong><em>What does our community need to work on? </em></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Raising awareness at national level</em></strong> Busy government officials may not even be aware that IATI exists, and we need greater efforts to promote the initiative. As stated in the report, donor country offices of leading IATI publishers have indicated an urgent need to raise awareness.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Supporting integration with in-country aid management systems </em></strong>We need to work together to ensure more countries implement the automatic import of IATI data into their AIMS. For this to be sustainable, there needs to be ownership by developing-country governments, as observed in Myanmar\u2019s <a href=\"https://mohinga.info/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Mohinga</a> and Bangladesh\u2019s own home-grown AIMS.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Evidence of value added </em></strong>To encourage more use, we need a clear evidence base on how IATI data adds value to government systems and their decision-making processes.</li>\n<li><strong><em>New solutions and tools for different users needs</em></strong> We need more in-depth research on what specific problems IATI can solve. This will contribute to developing appropriate support as well as technical and analytical tools.</li>\n<li><strong>Overcoming key technical obstacles </strong>Existing IATI tools need to be improved, in particular making IATI\u2019s Datastore (an online service that gathers all data published to the IATI standard) more user-friendly. Also required are improvements to data quality and the standard through better publication of data by organisations (such as accurate sub-locations, local language descriptions, use or related field to enable traceability of funds, etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To achieve the above, we need more investment, as well as political will, from many key stakeholders, including developing-country governments, donors and other non-state actors. Being at TAG 2017 has filled us with confidence that the IATI community is ready to meet these challenges.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/reaching-the-potential-a-review-of-iati-data-use-and-ways-to-increase-it/\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full report</a></strong></p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Reflections on the World Data Forum", "author": ["Bernard Sabiti"], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "06 Mar 2017", "description": "This post comments on the inaugural UN World Data Forum, which took place in Cape Town in early 2017, highlighting its significance for the data revolution.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/reflections-on-the-world-data-forum/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"><p>The inaugural <a href=\"http://undataforum.org/\" target=\"_blank\">UN World Data Forum</a>, which took place in Cape Town in January 2017, marked a turning point in the data revolution. For the first time, representatives from official statistics and from non-official data communities came together to discuss the data revolution. The scale of the challenge we face in addressing the data needs of Agenda 2030 means that a holistic approach is exactly what\u2019s needed.</p>\n</div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>The key consensus emerging from the conference \u2013 which was attended by 1,400 data experts \u2013 is that in order to leave no one behind, investment in civil registration and vital statistics is absolutely imperative. Improving registry and administrative data is an essential building block in creating sustainable data infrastructures. That <a href=\"http://undataforum.org/WorldDataForum/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ReleaseUNWDFclosing18JanFinal.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">over 100 countries do not keep accurate birth and death records</a>, and that many don\u2019t record causes of deaths, starkly highlights both the scale of the issue and also the huge potential of investment to close data gaps and \u2013 more importantly \u2013 ensure that we leave no one behind.</p>\n<p>Many delegates spoke of the need for improving administrative data to ensure that there is quality, local data that can be used for local decision-making. Yusuf Murangwa, the Director General of the Department of Statistics in Rwanda, made the point succinctly in our \u2018<a href=\"http://undataforum.org/WorldDataForum/sessions/leaving-no-one-behind/\" target=\"_blank\">Counting people to make people count\u2019 session</a>: \u201cIf we do it right, civil registration has the potential to make sure that we don\u2019t leave anyone behind. If we make sure we register every kid that is born \u2026 we can create a foundation of making sure that at least we know everyone and where they live.\u201d</p>\n<p>Improving civil registration and vital statistics is a crucial piece of the data revolution puzzle. Household surveys could be another piece of that puzzle, but is it one that can be relied on? At the World Data Forum there was an overall recognition of the importance of household surveys and the need to carry them out at least every three years. However, while surveys provide vital national-level information and statistics, they are not suitable for providing the local-level micro-information required for local-level decision-making. For example, most statistics produced in Uganda \u2013 including those derived from household surveys \u2013 cannot be usefully disaggregated below the subnational level, and so cannot be relied on by decentralised government departments for effectively planning service delivery. And Uganda is a country with a good system for household surveys.</p>\n<p>The limitations of household surveys not only build the case for investment in registry and administrative data, but they also add weight to arguments about the importance of finding new approaches both to meeting the data challenges of Agenda 2030 and to ensuring sustainable systems that function for countries\u2019 national and subnational needs. Our \u2018<a href=\"http://undataforum.org/WorldDataForum/sessions/pilots-for-perpetual-censuses-community-based-data-collection/\" target=\"_blank\">Pilots for perpetual censuses: community-based data collection</a>\u2019 panel gave innovators the opportunity to share their experiences of finding ways to better collect data for use by local decision-makers. The debates and examples discussed in this session are usefully summarised in our paper, \u2018<a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Long-term-investments-in-a-short-term-world.pdf%20\" target=\"_blank\">Long-term investments in a short-term world</a>\u2019. The overarching message is that we cannot rely on surveys alone to give us the detailed information we need about people in poverty, and the only solution is that investment must be made in areas such as community-based data collection and civil registration and vital statistics.</p>\n<p>The forum culminated in the launch of the <a href=\"http://undataforum.org/WorldDataForum/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Cape-Town-Action-Plan-For-Data-Jan2017.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Cape Town Global Action Plan for Sustainable Development Data</a>, which will be adopted by countries at the UN Statistical Commission in March 2017. The plan includes a number of objectives and actions categorised under six strategic areas:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Coordination and strategic leadership on data for sustainable development</li>\n<li>Innovation and modernisation of national statistical systems</li>\n<li>Strengthening of basic statistical activities and programmes with particular focus on addressing the monitoring needs of the 2030 Agenda</li>\n<li>Dissemination and use of sustainable development data</li>\n<li>Multi-stakeholder partnerships for sustainable development data</li>\n<li>Mobilise resources and coordinate efforts for statistical capacity building.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>An official, international commitment to improving data for sustainable development is a significant step in the right direction \u2013 the direction of building sustainable development infrastructures. What remains to be seen is how well this translates into action, and particularly action in priority areas. Will those funding improvements in data look beyond Millennium Development Goal-era methods for assessing poverty and invest in civil registration and vital statistics or in community-based data collection? Or will they stick to the traditional household surveys? Only time will tell, but what the UN World Data Forum has shown us is that the official and non-official data communities around the world are joining forces and refuse to get complacent about delivering a genuine revolution in data for development.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/monusco/14941155380/in/photolist-oLijXf-rbfEZg-q3ugzV-fxd2KY-jEhbsL-pnmBpF-ftAKni-jrL7L7-dTVF84-fmFpuz-fwJWW8-6T7JVx-4PM75g-g64hpJ-3q6iF-issbP7-kHeb3A-iiQJ4Z-kHefLd-iiPwC6-dTUPvc-kV6k33-p9zZLq-eYd5hv-iiFzq4-issb6d-imFtj8-qf9PP\" target=\"_blank\">Image credit:\u00a0Photo UNICEF DRC/Benoit Almeras</a></p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Disability and aid spending: Can we use the DAC\u2019...", "author": [], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "14 Feb 2017", "description": "This blog comments on the importance of disabled persons for the SDGs and argues that DAC\u2019s peer review mechanism should be adapted to be more inclusive.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/disability-and-aid-spending-can-we-use-the-dacs-peer-review-mechanism-to-ensure-aid-is-inclusive-of-persons-with-disabilities/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"><p>This is a guest blog written by Nick Corby, Associate Director of <a href=\"http://www.equalinternational.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Equal International</a></p>\n</div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including the underlying aim to leave no one behind, hinges upon resources, policies and programmes focusing on the most marginalised people. Persons with disabilities have until now been left behind by the development agenda, but the SDGs include a clear commitment to better include disability. The collection and use of accurate and relevant data is critically important to including persons with disabilities in the development agenda. The SDGs are unequivocal in recognising that persons with disabilities not only count, but that their needs and the impact of progress on them (or lack of it) must also be counted.</p>\n<p>Two previous blogs in this series identify how the inclusion of disability in international development can be better counted, including <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/disability-data-to-leave-no-one-behind/\" target=\"_blank\">through data disaggregated by disability</a> and <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/why-aid-data-needs-to-say-more-about-persons-with-disabilities/\" target=\"_blank\">by introducing an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC) disability marker</a>. The World Data Forum held in January 2017 in Cape Town, South Africa, <a href=\"http://undataforum.org/WorldDataForum/sessions/collecting-disability-data-toward-implementing-the-sustainable-development-goals-and-the-convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities/\" target=\"_blank\">demonstrated the growing political support and gathering momentum for both data disaggregation by disability and a DAC disability marker</a>. This blog focuses on one other mechanism that can be better utilised to track the inclusion of disability in aid: the DAC peer review mechanism.</p>\n<p>The OECD DAC conducts periodic reviews (approximately every five years) of the aid programmes of its 29 members with two main aims: 1) to help the country understand where it could improve its development strategy and structures so that it can increase the effectiveness of its investment, and 2) to identify and share good practice. By subjecting all members to examination and scrutiny, the DAC peer review mechanism serves to ensure donors are accountable, share learning and that their priorities are aligned with global goals and/or give greater focus to neglected issues. Ensuring that an issue is raised as part of a peer review can have a positive impact on the resources directed to that issue by DAC members. Increased attention in the DAC peer review mechanism on reproductive health, for example, has served to encourage donors to focus more on this once-neglected issue. Similarly, efforts to incorporate data on humanitarian spending and to include an examination of humanitarian activities in the peer review mechanism encouraged donors to increase their humanitarian support.</p>\n<p>The DAC peer review mechanism requires adaptation to better examine the efforts of DAC members against the \u2018leave no one behind\u2019 principle within the SDGs. Considerations around gender are already an integral part of any peer review. Expanding the focus on gender to look at the inclusion of people by other characteristics, for example age or disability, will significantly strengthen efforts by donors to leave no one behind.</p>\n<p>At present, disability is very rarely addressed by the peer review mechanism. The most recent peer review of Australia examined activities around disability, but this was an exception. How can this be changed so that the DAC peer review mechanism helps DAC members strengthen their approach to \u2018leave no one behind\u2019, for example, by routinely examining the inclusion of disability in their investments?</p>\n<p>A few solutions are immediately available, namely:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The DAC Peer Review Reference Guide includes indicators on social groups central to leave no one behind, including persons with disabilities. The reference guide sets out the key dimensions of analysis for any peer review. Persons with disabilities (or other marginalised groups) are not included in the guide, meaning that a DAC members\u2019 inclusion of disability (or lack of it) is not routinely considered in peer reviews.</li>\n<li>Technical experts on social groups at the heart of leave no one behind are appointed, including persons with disabilities. A humanitarian specialist based in the Development Cooperation Directorate was appointed when DAC members sought a greater focus on humanitarian activities in the peer review mechanism. The Directorate could appoint further specialists to significantly strengthen the peer review mechanism\u2019s focus on leave no one behind, or draw on external expertise.</li>\n<li>DAC guiding principles on leave no one behind, including the inclusion of persons with disabilities, are developed to further strengthen and set expectations for the aid programmes of DAC members. Lessons could be drawn from the existing guiding principles for gender equality.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The DAC peer review mechanism already has an extensive and complex set of issues it examines. We must recognise that the peer review mechanism cannot simply examine more and more issues, but a new global development agenda with new priorities requires changes be made to the DAC peer review mechanism. By integrating the underlying aim of the SDGs to leave no one behind and focusing more on key beneficiaries, including persons with disabilities, the DAC peer review mechanism can continue to fulfil its role.</p>\n<p>For more information on the issues discussed in this blog contact <a href=\"mailto:nick@equalinternational.org\">Nick Corby</a>, Equal International, <a href=\"mailto:Tony.German@devinit.org\">Tony German</a>, Development Initiatives, or <a href=\"mailto:polly.meeks@add.org.uk\">Polly Meeks</a>, ADD International.</p>\n<p><em>Nick Corby is Associate Director of </em><a href=\"http://www.equalinternational.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Equal International</em></a><em>, a consultancy group based in the UK and South Africa.

Welcome to the world of deflators \u2013 economic metrics that exist to enable the comparison of data, taking out the impact of inflation and exchange rates. This slightly mysterious discipline exercises the minds of our analysts at Development Initiatives in the maintenance of our\u00a0<a href=\"http://data.devinit.org/#!/\" target=\"_blank\">Development Data Hub</a>, which contains an array of financial and socioeconomic data for all countries in the world.</p>\n<p>In this age of globalisation you might assume that this is a very common issue so a standard approach to the problem would exist. But in reality this is not the case.</p>\n<p>There are three main ways of getting the US$ deflators\u2019 values: either by using\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/crsguide.htm\" target=\"_blank\">the official list provided by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)</a>, or by simple calculations of the data provided by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\u00a0[1]</p>\n<div class=\"mythemes-sh-list ordered circled normal\">\n<ol>\n<li>\n<div>Our analysts use a lot of data collected by the OECD, so this is their first port of call as they are keen to keep our calculations aligned with those of the original publisher. However, the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) only keeps deflators for its 56 members and reporters (a list which changes from year to year).</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>The IMF provides data on its 188 members.</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>The World Bank provides data for deflators on its 189 members as well as Andorra, Cuba, Lichtenstein and Monaco (who are not members of either the IMF or the World Bank).</div>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<p>If the formula for calculating deflators is pretty straightforward and common, then these deflators from three different sources should align. So, in the spirit of the Joined-up Data Standards project, we\u2019ve asked the question: can the three sources of deflators be used interchangeably for analytical purposes?</p>\n<p>And the short answer is that no, they can\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Take the deflators for Saudi Arabia, for instance.

This included an agreement to increase the use and coordination of cash-based programming.</p>\n<p>Until now however, there has not been a clear baseline on the current volume of humanitarian assistance delivered in the form of cash and vouchers.

Our data shows that the overall value of cash-based programming in 2015 was approximately US$1.9 billion. UN agencies accounted for around two-thirds of the total; and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) for just under a third. We estimate that 51% of cash-based programming was delivered in the form of cash transfers and 49% in vouchers. Most of these transfers (84%) were provided unconditionally \u2013 without qualifying conditions that a beneficiary must fulfil to receive a cash transfer or voucher, such as \u2018cash for work\u2019 initiatives.</p>\n<h4>Cash-based programming by organisation type, 2015</h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/counting-cash-blog-figure/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12330\" height=\"451\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1716px) 100vw, 1716px\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Counting-cash-blog-figure.png\" srcset=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Counting-cash-blog-figure.png 1716w, http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Counting-cash-blog-figure-768x202.png 768w\" width=\"1716\"/></a></p>\n<h6>Source: Development Initiatives based on data supplied by agencies operating cash and voucher programmes.<br/>\nNotes: This data is partial and representative of only the organisations where an accurate breakdown is possible; for this reason, data for UNHCR is not included.

RCRC: Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement; WFP: World Food programme</h6>\n<p>Our estimate of the volume of cash-based programming in 2015 required a labour-intensive data gathering and analysis exercise. It is important therefore to develop and sustain a more streamlined and systematic means of reporting on programming by cash, voucher or in-kind assistance. But getting it right will need a concerted effort to develop and align systems and standards, and ensure that the information generated is well analysed and used.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>\n<p>With this in mind, there are a number of practical recommendations in the report for improving the tracking of investments in cash-based programming. The main ones are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All actors \u2013 donors and implementing organisations \u2013 advocate for and invest in the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Financial Tracking Service (FTS) and the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) as the best long-term options for systematic global reporting on cash, voucher and in-kind expenditure.</li>\n<li>Agencies implementing cash-based programmes agree on a standard template for the reporting, collection and collation of \u2018who does what, where\u2019 data on assistance by modality, with cash- and voucher-specific fields, and coordinate its use at country-level. This data can be linked with the funding data on the FTS to give a picture of actual spending and delivery by modality.</li>\n<li>All relevant actors are consistent with the use of terminology and data on cash-based programming. That paves the way for agreeing on common ways to disaggregate the data and estimate the relevant programming costs that agencies incur as they build up internal capacity on cash. This financial data, if combined effectively with comparable data on results and impact, can be used to support decision-making on the best way of providing assistance in any given context.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of this will require coordination, at both technical and policy levels, combined with strong leadership and direction. Now is the time to make it happen \u2013 while the World Humanitarian Summit is fresh in our minds, and the will to make progress against Grand Bargain commitments is strong.</p>\n<p>\u2018Counting cash\u2019 is an essential part of making humanitarian action more efficient and effective for people affected by crises.</p>\n<p>The<strong> Global Humanitarian Assistance report 2017</strong> will feature analysis of the very latest data on cash programming.

On the surface, it\u2019s a very simple question too.</p>\n<p>But when I put this question to a major development agency a few years ago, I was surprised to see how laborious it was to piece the information together, project by project, from across the agency\u2019s \u00a34 billion bilateral aid programme. Although the agency gathered a wealth of transparency metrics, the information on disability just wasn\u2019t there.</p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t an isolated challenge: Concluding Observations from the <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CRPD/Pages/CRPDIndex.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities</a> have also pointed to a lack of data on the inclusion of persons with disabilities in development programming \u2013 for example in Germany (in May 2015) and the European Union (in October 2015).</p>\n<p>But luckily, in the case of donor governments under the auspices of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/dac/\" target=\"_blank\">Development Assistance Committee (DAC)</a>, the challenge could have a neat solution. The OECD\u2019s database on official development assistance (ODA) \u2013 the Creditor Reporting System (CRS) \u2013 includes \u2018markers\u2019 that flag aid flows for particular policy objectives such as <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/dac/gender-development/dac-gender-equality-marker.htm\" target=\"_blank\">gender equality</a>. If the system also included a marker for disability equality,<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a> that development agency would have had the tools to respond to my question in a matter of minutes.</p>\n<p>Bringing information on disability-inclusive aid flows to the fingertips of policymakers is critical to starting a conversation on whether aid allocations are living up to the global commitment to leave no one behind. The limited available data suggests that such a conversation is urgently needed. For example, in 2015, US academics painstakingly examined documents from some 2,500 World Bank projects. They concluded that <a href=\"http://aiddata.org/blog/tracking-investment-in-disability-inclusive-development\" target=\"_blank\">just 2%</a> were inclusive of persons with disabilities.</p>\n<p>Of course, the past 18 months have already seen some major commitments on disability data \u2013 such as on data disaggregation in the <a href=\"http://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/47th-session/documents/2016-2-SDGs-Rev1-E.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">SDG indicator framework</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/582315/Data-disaggregation-action-plan-Jan-2017.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">new plans</a> at individual agencies such as the UK Department for International Development (DFID). If more development actors get on board, these commitments <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/disability-data-to-leave-no-one-behind/\" target=\"_blank\">could be game-changing</a>, and at first sight, you might ask why another layer of data was needed too.</p>\n<p>But existing data commitments focus on outputs and outcomes (for example, numbers of people reached): and while such data is vital, the missing piece of the puzzle is to understand how these outputs and outcomes relate to development finance inputs.<a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\">[2]</a></p>\n<p>The added value of OECD DAC markers is that they are clearly input-focused. They report spending commitments, which means that they can provide an early warning if donor allocations are at risk of leaving some people behind \u2013 potentially years before this starts to show up in output and outcome data. And the more it is possible to marry up input and outcome data on disability (<a href=\"https://www.bond.org.uk/sites/default/files/resource-documents/leaving_no_one_behind_final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">combined with relevant qualitative information</a>), the more development actors will be able to make informed decisions on the relative value for money of different approaches to disability-inclusive programming.</p>\n<p>What is more, the OECD DAC CRS also offers the potential to record more granular data on disability. For example, it includes a code to track allocations for institutions and organisations working for women\u2019s rights. Introducing a similar code could, for instance, highlight the work of organisations of persons with disabilities, which our experience at <a href=\"https://www.add.org.uk/reports-resources/voices-marginalised\" target=\"_blank\">ADD International</a> shows can play a critical role in reversing misconceptions and discrimination.</p>\n<p>And because the OECD DAC markers are used by other data systems, successful introduction of a disability marker would have benefits beyond the CRS. In particular, organisations publishing data to the <a href=\"http://www.aidtransparency.net/\" target=\"_blank\">International Aid Transparency Initiative</a> (IATI) Standard would be able to use the disability marker, and those interested in analysing data on disability-related activities would be able to use tools like <a href=\"http://d-portal.org/ctrack.html?search=disability#view=main\" target=\"_blank\">d-portal</a> to extract this information from IATI data. But the results from this tool are only as good as the underlying data on which they are based \u2013 and until the data includes a systematic marker of disability inclusion, we will only ever get part of the picture.</p>\n<p>To be sure, markers are no silver bullet. They involve some subjectivity, and they only work if donors are prepared to use them. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for staff right across development agencies to be part of the process, and for work on data to go hand-in-hand with work on policy and awareness raising. This is what\u2019s begun to happen <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/dac/gender-development/Handbook-OECD-DAC-Gender-Equality-Policy-Marker.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">among many agencies that use the gender marker</a>, and \u2013 although challenges remain \u2013 analysis by Development Initiatives shows that uptake has steadily increased over time, and is now relatively high, around 89% for bilateral donors.</p>\n<p>Last summer, the OECD DAC proposed that the CRS could be updated to align more closely with the SDGs. This is a very welcome first step, and it couldn\u2019t have come at a better time, coinciding with a groundswell of interest in disability from a <a href=\"http://www.internationaldisabilityalliance.org/glad\" target=\"_blank\">widening community of donors</a>. The Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has <a href=\"http://www.cooperazioneallosviluppo.esteri.it/pdgcs/Documentazione/NormativaItaliana/PDA-INGLESE-ESEC-web.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">introduced a marker system</a> in its aid spending, and DFID is actively championing the introduction of a marker in the OECD DAC.</p>\n<p>Time will tell whether the OECD DAC can capitalise on this recent momentum, or whether some members will block progress. But for persons with disabilities, who for so long were invisible on the global development agenda, there\u2019s very little time to lose. The SDGs\u2019 vision of a world where no one is left behind is too important to fall at the first hurdle through a lack of basic aid data.</p>\n<p><em>Polly Meeks is Deputy Director of Policy and Influencing at </em><a href=\"https://www.add.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>ADD International</em></a><em>, a disability rights organisation supporting disability activists in Africa and Asia to bring social change.

Now, following the <a href=\"http://undataforum.org/\" target=\"_blank\">World Data Forum</a> in Cape Town in January 2017, there is real appetite for tackling the significant issues surrounding poverty data and <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/long-term-investments-in-a-short-term-world-arguments-for-sustainable-data/\" target=\"_blank\">ensuring developing countries are equipped with the data they need</a>. This is essential for driving long-term sustainable improvements in poverty levels and resilience of vulnerable groups. So how does the World Bank poverty measurement, and the changes being adopted, fit in with the more complex and detailed data needs of <a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld\" target=\"_blank\">Agenda 2030</a>?</p>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s the World Bank doing to help meet the challenges of Agenda 2030?</strong></p>\n<p>The World Bank\u2019s annual estimate of the number of people living in \u2018$X-a-day\u2019 poverty has carried a large amount of political power and provides a compelling narrative for anti-poverty groups. In fact, Goal 1.1 of the Sustainable Development Goals commits to ending extreme poverty by 2030. With the World Bank\u2019s poverty line being the very definition of extreme poverty, here the World Bank\u2019s calculations and monitoring are clearly vital.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/the-world-bank-is-changing-the-1-25-a-day-measure-of-extreme-poverty/\" target=\"_blank\">The calculations behind this poverty line have been complicated and involve many moving parts</a> and the Bank has now accepted one of the key recommendations, that the line be held constant at $1.90 2011 PPP (purchasing power parity) per person per day. It has also accepted referring to it as the \u2018international poverty line\u2019 and that it will be reported in local currencies for each country, making the line more adapted to local circumstances. The Bank has also partly committed to more transparency in the methodology and more input from outside experts and those in poverty. This is an important step towards changing the calculation of global poverty from an exercise carried out opaquely by economists in Washington to one that would genuinely engage with the world. In turn, this gives the goal to end extreme poverty more weight too.</p>\n<p>Another promising recommendation taken up is that the Bank will begin to report on indicators that may measure the conditions of the poorest 20% of people globally more effectively than income or consumption do \u2013 hence capturing multidimensional poverty better. In our work, we look at nutrition and civil registration figures as two key indicators for the lives of the P20, alongside income.</p>\n<p><strong>What does this mean for the lives of the poorest people?</strong></p>\n<p>Of course, the outstanding issue is the accuracy of data. The report noted several problems for poverty measurement, for example, the confidence intervals on poverty estimates are as wide as 20\u201330% for a single computational challenge (international price comparisons). There are also problems with population data, inflation, international comparisons and poverty surveys. The Bank has agreed to address some of these problems but its response has suggested that much of this lies outside its control. It also has rejected the Commission\u2019s call for external reviews of its methodology.</p>\n<p>To ensure that no one is left behind, it\u2019s particularly important to accurately measure the status of poorest 20% globally \u2013 <a href=\"http://devinit.org/p20i/\" target=\"_blank\">the P20</a>. The precise location of the international poverty line matters less than policy-makers knowing where people are and what issues matter to them. In particular, having data disaggregated to be able to examine which elements of identity matter most in someone\u2019s economic chances is very important \u2013 including a minimum of income quintile, gender, geography, age and disability. The Commission\u2019s report recommends that the Bank disaggregates poverty data to show how many women and children are in poverty. While the Bank has published the <a href=\"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/402511475417572525/New-estimates-of-extreme-poverty-for-children\" target=\"_blank\">number of children living in poverty globally</a>, it says that much further work is needed to measure the data on women. This is due to poverty being defined at household level and thus disguising gender disparities. For its data to be truly useful, the Bank needs to publish the data it holds on children that can be disaggregated at a national level, and to devote more resources to researching and tracking gender and poverty.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, there are a number of areas, covered in the Commission\u2019s report which, unless taken up, will severely hinder the Bank\u2019s ability to help ensure the poverty data needed for Agenda 2030 to be delivered will be severely hinder. Most notably these include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>identifying those who are not being counted in household surveys, including displaced people and refugees as well as those in informal housing or institutional settings, and to work with partners to fill these data gaps</li>\n<li>finding rapid, more agile surveys that can more readily be deployed in countries where surveys are lacking</li>\n<li>making better use of administrative data and explorations, to match national accounts to poverty data.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If these were enacted, they could revolutionise the global data landscape by making what\u2019s now invisible, visible.</p>\n<p>This leads onto perhaps one of the most important areas of action that needs to be taken. The World Bank needs to ensure that significant investments are made to improve data systems in countries around the world. The Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data recently issued <a href=\"http://opendatawatch.com/the-state-of-development-data-2016/\" target=\"_blank\">a report</a>, to which DI contributed, on the investments needed to finance a data revolution. It found that with relatively modest investments, national governments and the World Bank can ensure that everyone is counted and that the complicated task of assessing poverty can be dramatically improved. Unfortunately, <a href=\"http://opendatawatch.com/monitoring-reporting/2016-aid-for-statistics-inventory-of-financial-instruments/\" target=\"_blank\">evidence shows</a> \u00a0that the World Bank has recently significantly decreased financing for development data. It\u2019s now been over a year since the Sustainable Development Goals were ratified, and as we rapidly move into delivery and action, we need the World Bank and national partners to work together on getting the data we need to leave no one behind.</p>\n<p>Image courtesy: Pakistan Strategy Support Program</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "A new mindset for new goals", "author": ["Cat Langdon"], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "18 Jan 2017", "description": "The first UN World Data Forum is taking place in Cape Town, South Africa this week.

The UN Statistical Commission group on disability is larger than any other. Its painstaking work to develop internationally comparable census questions on the severity of disability has meant that we now have standard questions that can be and are applied in lots of settings and by lots of organisations.</p>\n<p>The census questions mean better data on the number of people with disabilities and this makes the impact of disability much more visible. Significantly, the census questions seek to identify the impact of disability not in an on/off sense by asking whether somebody is a person with a disability or not, but by capturing the extent and severity of a person\u2019s difficulty with sight or hearing, mobility, care, language. Importantly, they enable the data to be joined up.</p>\n<p>In Uganda, we can use the disability data along with survey data to better understand the extent to which disability results in exclusion from progress. The association of severe disability and lack of education is unsurprising but still shocking.</p>\n<h4>Level of education by severity of disability in Uganda</h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Disability-data-to-leave-no-one-behind-figure-1.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-12187\" height=\"625\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1094px) 100vw, 1094px\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Disability-data-to-leave-no-one-behind-figure-1.jpg\" srcset=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Disability-data-to-leave-no-one-behind-figure-1.jpg 1094w, http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Disability-data-to-leave-no-one-behind-figure-1-768x439.jpg 768w\" width=\"1094\"/></a></p>\n<p>Source: Development Initiatives based on Uganda Demographic and Health Survey 2011</p>\n<p>The same data and method can be used to explore, for instance, if disability is concentrated in particular areas within a country, in rural or urban areas, in households with or without toilets and so on.

How can this data be used to ensure that persons with disabilities are not left behind? Well first it can draw attention to scale: it can help to identify places, people and characteristics that lead to exclusion. But \u2013 equally important \u2013 it can also challenge the attitudes and discrimination that keep people invisible and poor because of some aspect of their identity. For example, the blind child whose teacher cannot understand what use education would be to him so suggests that he just sits at the back of the class or goes home, or the trader whose customers insist on paying a lower price simply because she is a wheelchair user.</p>\n<p>While there is still a very long way to go in getting consistent and complete disaggregated data on disability itself, there is another challenge to keep in mind. People have many identities and characteristics and it is often the combination of these that result in intractable exclusion and poverty.</p>\n<p>The acid test of Agenda 2030 will be whether people in <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/the-p20-methods-for-tracking-the-status-of-people-in-the-poorest-20/\" target=\"_blank\">the P20</a> \u2013 the poorest and most excluded 20% of the world\u2019s population \u2013 are included in progress. At a minimum we need data that is consistently disaggregated by income quintile, gender, geography, age and disability along with civil registration of births and deaths. Making sure people are visible and counted is a necessary condition for ensuring no one is left behind \u2013 and counting those people <em>most</em> likely to be excluded from progress is the first priority.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Read the other blogs in this series:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/why-aid-data-needs-to-say-more-about-persons-with-disabilities/\">Why aid data needs to say more about persons with disabilities</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/disability-and-aid-spending-can-we-use-the-dacs-peer-review-mechanism-to-ensure-aid-is-inclusive-of-persons-with-disabilities/\">Disability and aid spending: Can we use the DAC\u2019s peer review mechanism to ensure aid is inclusive of persons with disabilities?</a></p>\n<h2 class=\"h2 m-t--05 m-b--05\"></h2>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Understanding interoperability: joining up data to...", "author": ["Beata Lisowska"], "format": "Innovation blogs", "date": "15 Jan 2017", "description": "This presentation showcases the vital importance of interoperable data in planning and monitoring the delivery of the Sustainable Development Goals.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/understanding-interoperability-joining-data-meet-sustainable-development-goals/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>This presentation showcases the vital importance of interoperable data in planning and monitoring the delivery of the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wJTOo_1lFFE\" width=\"680\"></iframe></p>\n<p><em>This blog was written as a part of the\u00a0<a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/projects/joined-data-standards/\" target=\"_blank\">Joined-up Data Standards project</a>, a joint initiative between Development Initiatives and\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.publishwhatyoufund.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Publish What You Fund</a>.</em></p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Effective development aid through blended finance?...", "author": ["Cordelia Lonsdale"], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "10 Jan 2017", "description": "The concept of 'blended finance' is becoming increasingly popular in the humanitarian sector.

The recent discussions at the second High-Level Meeting of the <a href=\"http://effectivecooperation.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation</a> (GPEDC) in November were no different. The GPEDC is the premier forum for the development community: providers of development cooperation, partner countries, civil society, the private sector and more, and at the <a href=\"http://effectivecooperation.org/events/2016-high-level-meeting/\" target=\"_blank\">High-Level Meeting</a> they all came together to discuss and agree on how to improve development cooperation to end poverty and deliver the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">At the meeting, \u2018blended finance\u2019 was a hot topic.\u00a0 Donors have been turning increasingly toward blending private finance with development assistance, though many are not convinced that this is the best use of public funds for development. There\u2019s no doubt that <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/aligning-blended-finance-to-busan-principles\" target=\"_blank\">challenges exist</a> in ensuring blended finance is delivered in line with development effectiveness principles like country ownership, focus on results, inclusivity, transparency and mutual accountability.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The opportunity was ripe for a high-level conversation on the topic. So <a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Oxfam International</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.ukan.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">UK Aid Network</a> and Development Initiatives seized the opportunity with a side event to share recent studies and move the conversation forward.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Financing sustainable development</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">What was clear from the discussion, and from research about blending, is that there is no consensus about the value of blending official development assistance (ODA) with private sector investments for development impact. On the one hand, everyone realises the importance of needing to fill the financing gap and recognises the value of mobilising private resources to achieve the SDGs. On the other, there is little evidence allowing stakeholders to understand the opportunities and risks involved in blending, which has hampered policy dialogue.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">We hosted a side event at the Nairobi meeting to promote ideas and solutions to move forward, encourage mutual understanding between stakeholders, and inform the GPEDC community \u2013 particularly partner countries \u2013 on the ways blended finance might impact on the development landscape. DI\u2019s Executive Director, Harpinder Collacott, chaired the eminent panel, which was made up of a diverse array of stakeholders.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>How to make blended finance more effective</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Event participants, both blended finance critics and champions alike, agreed that there is a need to make blended finance more effective. They also agreed that this can only happen if all stakeholders \u2013 including those observing from the outside like civil society \u2013 continue to discuss ways to strengthen the poverty alleviating effects of blended finance. Here are four key takeaways and next steps:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>1. Blending may have value as one of several tools</strong> in the toolbox for financing the SDGs, particularly in specific country contexts and/or sectors but more could be done to ensure blended finance benefits people living in poverty. Panellists and participants from Africa, Latin America and South Asia shared examples of blended finance delivering results; mainly in the infrastructure, energy and climate sectors. It was also noted that ODA and \u201cOther Official Flows\u201d have been used in a variety of blended finance mechanisms that work differently, and can be tailored to various contexts and needs.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>2. Partner countries can utilize blended finance strategically</strong> for development alongside broader efforts to use aid to support and catalyse private sector investment \u2013 such as strengthening the environment for investment. There may be a place for both uses of aid. That said, more information is needed to ensure official resources are only used when private resources alone are truly insufficient, also known as proving additionality.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>3. We need to be cautious and safeguard against risks</strong>, especially to poor households. Strong governance and oversight is needed from partner country governments to ensure that private partners have positive impacts on development, as governments have primary responsibility for ensuring that benefits from private sector growth impact positively on the poorest people. Donors need to improve safeguards and provide greater transparency to ensure that private investments are accountable to communities and don\u2019t harm livelihoods or the environment.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>4. More work is needed to develop definitions, guidelines</strong>, policies, and impact and results frameworks for blended finance. The work that donors of the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) are doing in this area needs to include a wider range of stakeholders. The GPEDC should work to bring its experience and knowledge to inform blended finance providers and policymakers about development effectiveness and enhancing sustainability and impact on poverty reduction.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The High-Level Meeting in Nairobi provided a great opportunity to orient blended finance more meaningfully toward poverty reduction. The meeting\u2019s <a href=\"http://effectivecooperation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/OutcomeDocumentEnglish.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Outcome Document</a> pushes stakeholders to improve how blended resources are used, calling on stakeholders to \u201cset clear effectiveness commitments\u201d for development cooperation aimed at leveraging private investment. And these commitments will be captured and monitored through the GPEDC monitoring framework to ensure follow-through. In addition, engagement with OECD DAC discussions on reforming ODA to include private sector instruments and upcoming effectiveness policy debates \u2013 such as the 2017 Financing for Development Forum \u2013 are important technical next steps.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>The entry was posted by Cordelia Lonsdale (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/Claudie_L\">@Claudie_L</a>), Policy and Engagement Advisor, Development Initiatives, and Julie Seghers (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JulieSeghers\">@JulieSeghers</a>), Oxfam\u2019s Advocacy Advisor on Aid and Development Finance, on 5 January 2017.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Read the <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/innovation-and-effectiveness-challenges-risks-and-opportunities-for-blended-finance\" target=\"_blank\">full write-up of the event</a> and more information on blended finance.</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "The use of data by government actors in Nepal to s...", "author": ["Louisa Dennison"], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "20 Dec 2016", "description": "The ability of national and local government actors in developing countries like Nepal to produce and use relevant, timely and disaggregated data is critic", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/the-use-of-data-by-government-actors-in-nepal-to-solve-development-problems/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"><p>Among others, government officials, civil society advocates, data intermediaries, private businesses, researchers and donors all play important roles in a country\u2019s development data ecosystem.</p>\n</div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>The ability of national and local government actors in developing countries like Nepal to produce and use relevant, timely and disaggregated data is critical to development success and sustainability.

And if\u00ad not why are we putting so much time and effort into generating more and more of it?</p>\n<p>It is absolutely true that data has immense potential to lead to positive change in people\u2019s lives, whether that\u2019s by improving targeting of health services, identifying risks associated with weather patterns, or understanding barriers to education. However, simply producing more data \u2013 open or otherwise \u2013 is not enough.</p>\n<p>What\u2019s really needed is more useable data.</p>\n<p>We live in a world full of data. But what is often lacking is the context that would make it useable. Only when data is compared to other data \u00ad\u2013 within or between countries, regions, sectors or over time \u00ad\u2013 is that context added. And it is then that people can begin to use data to affect change.</p>\n<p>The problem facing those wanting to make use of the huge array of data that\u2019s becoming available is that this comparability often simply does not exist. Data is being published in different formats, to different standards or on different platforms, with no easy way of linking it up. In many cases the data that is produced is done so in formats that are not machine-readable, let alone interoperable.</p>\n<p>The impacts of not being able to compare data are very real. Take the fight against malaria for example; research we\u2019ve carried out as part of our work on\u00a0<a href=\"http://juds.joinedupdata.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Joined-Up Data Standards</a> has shown that it\u2019s not possible to see a full picture of what resources are being spent on fighting the disease. This is because international donors report data to one system and national governments report it to another. The result of this is that it\u2019s not possible to understand how much resource is needed to beat the disease in different contexts, so allocating resources based on evidence becomes impossible. If there was just one system, or the two systems were interoperable, agencies would have the ability to understand current resourcing and likely future needs. This is just one example, but the same logic applies in all spheres and all sectors.</p>\n<p>The need for comparison between data is identified in Principle Four of the <a href=\"http://opendatacharter.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Open Data Charter</a>, which states:</p>\n<p><em>\u201cWe recognize that in order to be most effective and useful, data should be easy to\u00a0compare within and between sectors, across geographic locations, and over time.</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cWe recognize that data should be presented in structured and standardized formats\u00a0to support interoperability, traceability, and effective reuse.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Data interoperability is key to unlocking the potential of data in achieving social progress for all. Interoperability would mean that the data produced to different standards, or different systems, would become comparable by machine so computers could do the hard work without the need for timely manual human intervention. This will make it a far simpler task for decision-makers to assess needs, evaluate the impact of interventions and drive evidence-based change, whether that\u2019s in policing, health services, social care or international development.</p>\n<p>If we know that data interoperability is needed what can we do to actually make it happen?</p>\n<p>A lot of the data that is needed to make decisions to drive social progress is produced by various national and international bodies without consideration of how their data needs to sit alongside others\u2019 to build a holistic picture and enable evidenced-based decisions to be made. What is needed is a sea-change in the approach of data standard-setters, producers and users: it\u2019s imperative to move away from producing data in isolation, publishing it in a format that suits just one specific purpose and forgetting the bigger picture. If we continue to work in silos \u2013 in individual sectors, in individual countries \u2013 we will never unlock the potential of data to drive real change.</p>\n<p>Interoperablity is the new frontier for the open data movement. We must break the barriers that prevent data from being joined-up. We must make data interoperable. That is how valuable context can be added to the wealth of data that now exists. Without this context, we\u2019re simply producing numbers and not the vital information that\u2019s needed to deliver social progress for all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>* Any views expressed in this article are those of the author and not of Thomson Reuters Foundation.</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Why do databases need metadata?", "author": ["Beata Lisowska"], "format": "Innovation blogs", "date": "23 Nov 2016", "description": "Why do metadata standards matter?

It can help us track if girls and boys have equal access to education, and observe trends in child and mother mortality at birth in developing countries, for example. In doing so, it can help us to target interventions for maximum impact and to ensure that no one is left behind.</p>\n<p>However, data without context \u2013 such as who published that data, where it is published and in what format, when or how the data was collected \u2013 is incomplete and can be misleading. This context is added by supplying metadata: structured information that describes, explains, locates, or otherwise makes it easier to retrieve, use and manage data. For this context to be read by machines as well as humans, metadata needs to be standardised across datasets and data portals. In other words there is a need for metadata to speak the same language (common metadata standards).</p>\n<p>In the era of digital data, where machine-readable files make it possible to complete in seconds tasks that would once have been arduous and manual, the layer of machine- and human-readable metadata must come hand in hand. Why? Because such metadata standards increase the discoverability of datasets and make it easier for the user to search for what they are looking for across multiple platforms.</p>\n<h3><strong>The example</strong></h3>\n<p>The\u00a0<a href=\"http://data.devinit.org/#!/\" target=\"_blank\">Development Data Hub</a>\u00a0is Development Initiatives (DI)\u2019s flagship online resource for the discovery of financial and resource flow data. The tool brings together multiple datasets and through interactive visualisations allows the user to understand how resources designated for development are spent.</p>\n<p>With a click of a button it is possible to visualise where the poorest 20% of people are in the world or unbundle official development assistance (ODA) data by sector, recipient, donor, form or channel. The Data Hub allows the user to compare ODA across sectors, countries, and channels. How? The tool collates data from a variety of sources and combines it to produce dynamic visualisations. These complex visualisations are accompanied by a dynamically created downloadable dataset.</p>\n<p>As with the vast majority of databases like this, the Data Hub would benefit from an additional machine-readable layer of context that could direct the user to the relevant information on the data source that produces the dynamic visualisation. Since the Data Hub is dynamic, in an ideal world, so too would be the metadata standard that provides the information on when the data was published, who published it, when it was last updated, where it can be downloaded and how it was generated.</p>\n<p>The World Wide Web Consortium (<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/\" target=\"_blank\">W3C</a>)\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/CR-dwbp-20160830/#metadata\" target=\"_blank\">\u2018Data on the Web Best Practices</a>\u2019 states that providing metadata is a \u2019fundamental requirement when publishing data on the Web\u2019 and advises that that metadata should be provided in both human- and machine-readable format. Machine-readable format is a crucial requirement, as this allows computer applications to process it.</p>\n<p>Development Initiatives is a leading curator of value-added joined-up data and is committed to improving the interoperability of all development-related and humanitarian data. Can DI adhere to the W3C principle of publishing metadata in a human and machine-readable format?</p>\n<h3><strong>The challenge</strong></h3>\n<p>DI discovers and collects empirical and processed data from a variety of sources. These range from global datasets \u2013 maintained by institutions such as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, UN Statistics Division and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development \u2013 to national statistics and new collections of emerging data manually curated by its analysts.</p>\n<p>The relevant data from these sources are loaded into the Development Data Warehouse, which uses a collection of generic data models to integrate, where possible, data from these disparate sources into standardised, joined-up database schema.</p>\n<p>This is used to create datamarts containing purpose built joined-up datasets, each potentially containing data derived from a range of sources that drive context-specific visualisations designed by DI\u2019s analysts for the Development Data Hub.</p>\n<p>Figure 1 presents a simplified architecture of the system described here.</p>\n<p>This growing complex of interconnected data serving a range of digital products poses three problems:<b></b></p>\n<div class=\"mythemes-sh-list ordered circled medium\">\n<ol>\n<li>Firstly, how does DI, and how do Data Hub users, keep track of what data is available and whether it is up to date?</li>\n<li>\n<div>Secondly, the intellectual credibility of DI\u2019s work depends on metadata that explains the provenance and methodology of its analysts\u2019 calculations. In paper reports you can find this in small-print footnotes, but how do you replicate this for dynamically produced datasets that have been generated from an interactive visualisation?</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>Thirdly, the joined-up \u2018raw\u2019 databases in the warehouse will, in future, become a public good with an open API. How will third-party developers wanting to make use of this repository access the metadata they will need to accompany the data they extract?</div>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<h3><strong>What\u2019s the answer?</strong></h3>\n<p>Why do we need metadata standards to handle this problem? The transitions from data source to data warehouse to data series through datamart and finally to dataset cannot just be comprehensible from a human point of view. The logic needs to be encoded in a machine-readable way so that machines can point a data-user back to the original source of the transformed data and allow the discoverability and searchability of related datasets. At its heart, this is a joined-up (meta)data standards problem. Our latest discussion paper explores how this problem could be addressed.</p>\n<p>Joined-up Data Standards will present<a href=\"http://juds.joinedupdata.org/discussion-papers/paper-5-data-catalog-vocabulary/\" target=\"_blank\">\u00a0this technical discussion paper\u00a0</a>at\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/2016/11/sdsvoc/\" target=\"_blank\">the W3C and VRE4EIC-organised workshop on \u2018Smart Descriptions &amp; Smarter Vocabularies</a>\u2019 in Amsterdam on 30\u20131 December 2016.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://juds.joinedupdata.org/discussion-papers/paper-5-data-catalog-vocabulary/figure1-dp5/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-871\"><img alt=\"Figure 1.

The importance of data is now firmly grounded in the ambitions of the 2030 Agenda, and leaving no-one behind is at its heart. Crucially, these new goals and commitments require a different mindset and different tools to measure and monitor progress.</p>\n<p>While existing statistics help us track national averages, they do not focus enough on who is included in progress and who is left behind. For data to be fit for purpose, we need to know exactly who the poorest people are and whether they are part of global progress. For this, global and local communities will need to harness the power of the data revolution and ensure that progress is monitored by accurately counting individual people everywhere.</p>\n<p>Part of Development Initiatives\u2019 efforts on this is our new<a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/page/p20i\" target=\"_blank\"> P20 Initiative</a>. The P20 Initiative will track progress based on key data for the poorest 20% of people globally, promoting the use of data disaggregated by income quintile, geography, gender, age and disability. In any country, if the status of this group fails to improve, then the success of the 2030 Agenda will be out of reach.</p>\n<p>Our <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/p20-initiative-data-to-leave-no-one-behind\" target=\"_blank\">consultation paper</a>, just launched, uses the best data available to establish who the people in the P20 are, where they live, and what we can say about their status as a group across three key bellwether indicators, namely: income, nutrition and civil registration. The question that underpins our work is: are the poorest 20% of people getting their share of global progress, or are they being left behind? We want to know if people in the P20 are better off, better nourished and being counted by their governments.</p>\n<p><strong>Why these </strong><strong>bellwether indicators?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rising <em>incomes</em> give people choice and control over the goods and services they need \u2013 whether to invest in a home or a livelihood, in food, health, education or information.</li>\n<li>Better <em>nutrition</em> underpins health, as well as the ability to learn and earn.</li>\n<li><em>Civil registration</em> means people count and have rights. We cannot begin to track if every individual has access to basic health, education or economic growth if we do not know they exist.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What do we know so far?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The gap between the poorest 20% of people and everyone else is getting bigger</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Income-gap-is-getting-bigger.jpg\"><img alt=\"income-gap-is-getting-bigger\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-11824 size-full\" height=\"770\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1377px) 100vw, 1377px\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Income-gap-is-getting-bigger.jpg\" srcset=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Income-gap-is-getting-bigger.jpg 1377w, http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Income-gap-is-getting-bigger-768x429.jpg 768w\" width=\"1377\"/></a></p>\n<p><em>Figure source: Development Initiatives based on <a href=\"http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet\" target=\"_blank\">PovcalNet</a></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Currently the P20 receive less than 1% of the world\u2019s income. They will need to share in a greater proportion of global growth if they are not to be left behind.</li>\n<li>The P20 account for 44% of all under-5 cases of stunting.</li>\n<li>More than half of all unregistered births are in the P20.</li>\n<li>The P20 are spread across over 100 countries, although around three quarters live in just nine countries.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The data we already have goes some way to helping us build a profile of those who fall into this category. People in the P20 are more likely to be casual labourers than to have a secure job \u2013 and are more likely to work in hazardous environments and often on exploitative terms. They are more likely to be living in conflict-affected places, remote rural areas and urban slums. As families, they have very few assets, so an illness, the loss of work, a mudslide or a drought can push people and their loved ones into deeper poverty. The P20 are also likely to be held back by discrimination which reinforces disadvantage \u2013 this may be because of aspects of their identity such as gender, religion, caste, sexual orientation, disability, age or citizenship status.</p>\n<p>This profile of the P20 is built on the best available data, but it is only a starting point. Progress on reducing poverty globally and inequalities across countries can only be measured with disaggregated data and by ensuring everyone is counted. At its most basic, data should be disaggregated by income quintile, geography, gender, age and disability (QGGAD). This requires going beyond the household level and counting each and every person.</p>\n<p>The current data landscape does not provide sufficient data in all locations about people and the services they have access to. For example, poverty data relies on survey data but surveys often miss out key groups such as the homeless, refugees and other marginalised groups in society. We must invest in and improve civil\u00a0registration and vital statistics, as well as ensure more censuses occur so that everyone is counted.</p>\n<p>The urgency of making progress means that we should utilise the data that does exist despite its shortcomings. However, to achieve a radical poverty eradication agenda, we must also urgently invest in better, disaggregated data and statistics.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/page/p20i\" target=\"_blank\">Find out more about the P20 Initiative here</a>.</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "International Open Data Conference, extractives se...", "author": ["Beata Lisowska"], "format": "Innovation blogs", "date": "17 Oct 2016", "description": "Prior to the\u00a0International Open Data Conference in Madrid, I was invited by the\u00a0Natural Resource Governance Institute\u00a0(NRGI) to participate in the\u00a0extracti", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/international-open-data-conference-extractives-sector-joined-data-standards/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>Prior to the\u00a0<a href=\"http://opendatacon.org/\" target=\"_blank\">International Open Data Conference in Madrid</a>, I was invited by the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.resourcegovernance.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Natural Resource Governance Institute</a>\u00a0(NRGI) to participate in the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/extractives-data-dive-iodc-pre-event-tickets-27351963459\" target=\"_blank\">extractives data deep-dive</a>.

It was in this environment that the comparison between mandatory disclosure data and Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (<a href=\"https://eiti.org/\" target=\"_blank\">EITI</a>) figures was brought to the group\u2019s attention by\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/antnrueh?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\">Anton R\u00fchling</a>\u00a0from\u00a0<a href=\"http://openoil.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Open Oil</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidmihalyi\" target=\"_blank\">David Mihalyi</a>\u00a0from NRGI.</p>\n<p>My own understanding of the issue is that the EITI standard data represents a country\u2019s own reporting of extractives activities, such as tax and legal frameworks, production and revenues. Mandatory disclosure of payments to government in France and Great Britain, on the other hand, provides a wealth of reports on companies\u2019 payments over US$100,000 to the government where they operate in this sector. The two reporting systems should complement each other \u2013 tracking companies\u2019 activities in a given country and tracking what that country is reporting. As such, these two data sources should allow for double-checking of payments to governments. In\u00a0<a href=\"https://eiti.org/FAQ\" target=\"_blank\">EITI\u2019s own words</a>\u00a0\u201cThe EITI and mandatory disclosure are not in an \u201ceither/or\u201d relationship.

Here we ponder if the problems that emerge from his data analysis stem from data standards interoperability. As the author writes in his conclusions:</p>\n<p>\u201cA comparison, however, proves to be challenging. Important factors to consider range from simple basics such as reporting cycles and comparable currencies up to complex issues of interpretations of what a project is, what can be considered as \u2018payments to government\u2019, or the influence of company shares on payment figures.\u201d</p>\n<p>It becomes apparent then that the issues encountered are not too far removed from the results of our research.</p>\n<p>In our work we advocate for a joining-up of the classifications to conserve the meaning and make contextual translations between data standards and explore how data can be joined-up. For example, the disparities between the definition of a project in the EITI or the currencies reported, as highlighted in the blog, are just two of the problems that stem from not speaking the same language across data standards. It seems that extractives provide a prime example of how necessary joining-up of data, definitions and classifications is.</p>\n<p>Fundamentally, the aim of the EITI is to promote national debate and inform policy. However, at the heart of the data problem in the extractives sector is that similar data is being provided by a number of different data publishers in varying formats: between countries and across subsectors. If there is data available now that essentially describes the same thing it should be comparable in one way or another.</p>\n<p>Comparative analyses are currently challenging and very time-consuming even for experienced users and this problem is not unique to extractives data. Imagine though if these data standards were linked in a machine-readable format. What if getting the meaning and translations between definitions would take you seconds rather than days? If you could investigate information even with limited technical capacity at your disposal, what advances are waiting to be discovered?</p>\n<p>The tools are out there and clearly there is a need to link-up data standards, all we now need is the will from data standards setters themselves to help make this a reality.</p>\n<h3>How do mandatory disclosures relate to EITI figures?</h3>\n<div class=\"postauthor\">\n<p><em>This blog was originally posted by\u00a0<a href=\"http://openoil.net/author/paul-dziedzic/\" rel=\"author\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Posts by Paul Dziedzic\">Paul Dziedzic</a>\u00a0on Thursday, April 14, 2016 on\u00a0<a href=\"http://openoil.net/2016/04/14/how-do-mandatory-disclosures-relate-to/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenOil</a>\u00a0website</em><a href=\"http://openoil.net/2016/04/14/how-do-mandatory-disclosures-relate-to/#respond\"><br/>\n</a></p>\n<p>This year\u2019s introduction of mandatory disclosures in France and the UK will bring about a considerable amount of reports listing extractive companies\u2019 payments to governments.</p>\n<p>The mandatory disclosures promise increased transparency, however, we are only at the beginning of a debate on how to best make use of the new data. One idea has already become apparent: comparing the mandatory disclosure data to EITI figures in order to find irregularities.</p>\n<p>In the context of our involvement in Publish What You Pays \u201cData Extractors\u201d programme, we have simulated how such a comparison could look like and formulated a few first thoughts, as detailed in this\u00a0<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s32_vlz7twWIEJeyc3li3LFKunYyspr8elC7nRPsUTI/edit\" target=\"_blank\">document</a>. In this, we try to assess how these different sources referring to the same project relate to each other, in fact, how comparable they are after all. In the following, we would like to highlight a few aspects one has to take into account when comparing the two datasets.</p>\n<h5>Payments to government 2014 EITI/Company Reports Comparison</h5>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Payments-to-government-2014-EITI-Company-Reports-Comparison.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15676\" height=\"384\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Payments-to-government-2014-EITI-Company-Reports-Comparison.jpg\" width=\"686\"/></a></p>\n<p>Since the most actual EITI reports date from 2014, we needed to make sure the company reports were also covering that same year. This limited our comparison to the four companies in the Oil &amp; Gas sector, that had both published payments to the government reports and that are operating in one of the few countries for which there already is a 2014 EITI report available. In total, we had six cases. The graph above represents the comparison between the EITI data (in blue) and the figures put forward by the companies (in red) on payments to government. In all cases, we found that the two reports had diverging figures. Deviations range from 0.84% (Mnazi Bay) up to almost 200% (Tullow in Rovuma Area 2&amp;5). This begs the question as to why both reports fail to show the same results:<b>\u00a0</b></p>\n<div class=\"mythemes-sh-list ordered circled normal\">\n<ol>\n<li>\n<div>\n<p><b>Staggered Reporting Cycles</b></p>\n<p>The reporting cycles may diverge. We can see this, for instance, when we want to compare Wentworth operations with the matching EITI reports. These are Mozambique and Ghana. In Mozambique, both reports cover the same timeframe, January 1st, 2014 to december 31st. However, in Tanzania, the EITI report refers to a cycle from June 31, 2013 to June 31, 2014, whereas Wentworth covers January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014.</p>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>\n<p>\u00a0<b>Project / Company Conflation</b></p>\n<p>Some reports relate to projects, other to companies. EITI reports often list payments by companies rather than by projects. However, there are companies that have only one project in the country, which they operate as part of a group. Statoil, for instance, is listed as a company in the EITI reports, and the figure for its payments in the Mozambique is higher than that in Statoil\u2019s report. One reason being that Statoil has only 65% interest in the project. Without the other shareholding companies\u2019 reports, we cannot have a full comparison with the EITI report.</p>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>\n<p><b>What is a \u2018payment to government\u2019?</b></p>\n<p>There are differences in what counts as \u2018payments to government\u2019. We went through the reports and looked at the items listed as payments. Tullow\u2019s report in the Deepwater Tano project in Ghana for instance includes a range of items that are not included in Ghana\u2019s EITI report, such as VAT, local payroll taxes, withholding taxes or infrastructure improvement. It seems that these items are at the discretion of each EITI member state.</p>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<p>This exercise has shown one methodology to analyse the data around EITI reports and the new incoming data from the EU mandatory disclosures. Although such a comparison proves to be challenging, it might help to prepare a thorough analysis that could lead to a more transparent and standardised reporting, as well as, in the best case scenario, helping to find the missing millions.</p>\n</div>\n<p><em>This blog was written as a part of the\u00a0<a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/projects/joined-data-standards/\" target=\"_blank\">Joined-up Data Standards project</a>, a joint initiative between Development Initiatives and\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.publishwhatyoufund.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Publish What You Fund</a>.</em></p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "The Busan principles and blended finance: time to ...", "author": ["Cordelia Lonsdale"], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "07 Oct 2016", "description": "\"Our partnership is founded on a common set of principles that underpin all forms of development co-operation.

At the same time, we recognise that the ways in which these principles are applied differ \u2026 among the different types of public and private stakeholders involved.\u201d [para 8]</em></p>\n<p>In fact, <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/dac/effectiveness/busanadherents.htm\" target=\"_blank\">a number of non-governmental actors have signed up to support the Busan agreement</a>, reflecting the shift from the \u2018aid effectiveness\u2019 agenda to the \u2018development effectiveness\u2019 agenda. This list of \u2018adherents\u2019 even includes a number of institutions (such as the European Investment Bank) that are currently partners for donors, delivering blended finance. Blended finance, meaning using public inputs (often money, sometimes technical support) to attract or mobilise private investments through various different setups, has been on the rise; proposed by key donors as a way of turning \u2018billions to trillions\u2019.</p>\n<p>Of course, in practice, the Busan principles (and corresponding indicator framework) have mainly been used to assess traditional development cooperation partnerships, involving official development assistance (ODA). Reviews of the development effectiveness of blended finance by some experts and stakeholders, particularly civil society, have been less than positive, highlighting challenges that key implementing actors like development finance institutions (DFIs) have in complying with the principles \u2013 mostly around country ownership, transparency and the difficulties of delivering, or measuring, developmental outcomes. This usually leads to the conclusion that blended finance is not an effective form of development cooperation, since DFIs can\u2019t or won\u2019t comply fully with the indicators of effectiveness as they currently stand (and especially, arguing that it\u2019s not a good use of ODA). And yet, because there\u2019s so little concrete evidence, it\u2019s difficult to make a sound argument for or against its effectiveness as a development cooperation tool, beyond understanding that it doesn\u2019t behave like budget support ODA \u2013 which is quite clear already.</p>\n<p>The trouble with stopping here is that blended finance is still being used by donors, and in fact, is being scaled up. The tools we have for understanding blended finance don\u2019t quite fit; so we can\u2019t easily gather evidence on whether it works or not. Without this, we have a conversation driven by institutional perspectives, ideologies and political priorities. Getting a framework that fits can help inform the political debate with evidence \u2013 and promote mutual understanding about what effective blending looks like. It also empowers a wider range of stakeholders to participate in the conversation, a principle at the heart of effective development cooperation.</p>\n<h4>What we learned about blended finance and development effectiveness</h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Aligning-blended-finance-with-the-Busan-principles-of-development-effectiveness_DI_discussion-paper.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">For our latest discussion paper</a>, DI reviewed all the available evidence \u2013 policies and practices of blended finance used by blended finance actors \u2013 and looked at how well the Busan principles are currently reflected. Using what we learned about these new forms of cooperation, we then tried to adapt the indicators to reflect the essential rationale of the Busan principles in the \u2018blended finance\u2019 context. At the end of the paper, we present a sample framework of new indicators of \u2018effectiveness\u2019 in blended finance. A warning to readers: the available evidence on blending is patchy, and our conclusions are not the last word. However, here are three key takeaways.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Country ownership looks different in blended finance, but it is still important. </strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Country ownership could seem to be simply incompatible with blended finance \u2013 but we need to see past this to motivate and incentivise actors to behave differently. In fact, there are good practice examples of blending aligned with country priorities and plenty that could reasonably be done to improve its alignment. The following indicators of effectiveness for blending may be useful:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ensuring compliance of blended finance with national legal and regulatory frameworks for doing business (with the assumption they are linked to national planning priorities)</li>\n<li>enhancing the role and accountability of local authorities in country results frameworks (as they mainly interact with DFIs doing deals)</li>\n<li>strategically aligning blended finance investments with national priorities of the country.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It\u2019s also important to consider strong country-owned industrial policies that are shared with partners, and think about inclusion of DFIs in national or regional public\u2013private dialogue.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Public\u2013private partners in blending have more common ground for discussion under \u2018Results\u2019 and \u2018Transparency\u2019 than under \u2018Country ownership\u2019 and \u2018Inclusive partnerships\u2019.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Since all actors involved in blending that we looked at think that the two measures of effectiveness \u2018Results\u2019 and \u2018Transparency\u2019 are critically important (though they implement them differently), these may be easier places to start dialogue and promote mutual understanding.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Making blended finance \u2018effective\u2019 means helping different stakeholders to understand each other\u2019s language, perspectives and priorities.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Blending is so new that the conversation is just getting started. One big challenge is that stakeholders in the public and private sector (for example, a donor and their bilateral DFI) don\u2019t always understand each other well, and often have different visions of what \u2018effectiveness\u2019 means on the ground. (In the paper, we give an example of how a deal involving a DFI is generated in country, which can help illustrate the different actors that are involved from traditional development cooperation.) This makes it extra challenging for any partner country to try and shift the priorities of this array of new partners around to their nationally agreed priorities, and to be heard in dialogue. Generating evidence and mutual understanding about effectiveness between all stakeholders is important, as is reaching a better understanding of each other\u2019s language. We hope that our paper can play a role in driving the discussion forward.</p>\n<p>Read our discussion paper: \u2018<a href=\"http://devinit.org/aligning-blended-finance-to-busan-principles/\" target=\"_blank\">Aligning blended finance to Busan principles</a>\u2018</p>\n<p>Also on this\u00a0topic:<br/>\n<a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/di-kicks-off-project-on-blended-public%E2%88%92private-finance-for-development\" target=\"_blank\">Read about our blended finance project<br/>\n</a>Read the first discussion paper in this series: \u2018<a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/the-role-of-blended-finance-in-the-2030-agenda-setting-out-our-analytical-approach\" target=\"_blank\">The role of blended finance in the 2030 Agenda: setting out an analytical approach</a>\u2019</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/di-kicks-off-project-on-blended-public%E2%88%92private-finance-for-development\"><br/>\n</a>Photo: CIF Action</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Friday Lunchtime Lecture at the Open Data Institut...", "author": [], "format": "Innovation blogs", "date": "30 Sep 2016", "description": "More data is being produced than ever before, and more and more of it is becoming openly available.

This provides a snapshot of available data and evidence on people affected by forced displacement, the allocation of available resources, and funding mechanisms \u2013 highlighting areas where data must be strengthened for an effective and durable response.</p>\n<h3><strong>Better understanding of long-term livelihood needs</strong></h3>\n<p>The factsheet shows how important it is to move beyond short-term emergency assessment and financing cycles and target longer-term livelihood assistance for refugees through development frameworks. Most refugee situations are protracted, and it\u2019s estimated that <a href=\"http://www.unrefugees.org/what-we-do\">refugees are displaced for 17 years on average</a>, so there is a pressing need to foster more durable solutions.</p>\n<p>Understanding the levels of poverty among refugee populations is a vital part of this, yet refugees are not systematically included in internationally comparable national poverty surveys. Refugees were only included in national poverty surveys by 7 of the 20 countries hosting the largest numbers of refugees in 2015. For another 7 countries, methodological survey documents didn\u2019t state whether refugees were included or not. This calls for a clearer and more systematic methodological approach for including refugees in national poverty surveys.</p>\n<h3><strong>Fostering more durable solutions</strong></h3>\n<p>Rising global levels of forced displacement, which reached a record high of 65.3 million in 2015, have driven an increase in humanitarian financing requirements since 2013. While humanitarian appeals play a key role in responding to refugee flows, they are often ill-suited to addressing the protracted nature of most displacement, and people\u2019s longer-term livelihood needs.</p>\n<p>There continues to be a mismatch between what we know and how we respond. We know that refugees don\u2019t only need shelter and food assistance over a one-year timeframe but also require longer-term livelihood and employment opportunities. Yet, we continue to use short-term response models.</p>\n<p>However, some new initiatives are beginning to emerge which seek to break out of these shorter-term cycles, with multilateral development banks playing a key role. For example, the <a href=\"https://menafinancing.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Middle East and North Africa (MENA) Financing Initiative</a> was established by the World Bank, UN and Islamic Development Bank in 2015 to provide Lebanon and Jordan with concessional finance. And the <a href=\"http://www.ebrd.com/news/2016/responding-to-the-forced-displacement-crisis.html\" target=\"_blank\">Community Resilience Programme</a> was established by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in July 2016 to provide support to municipal services in Turkey and Jordan.</p>\n<p>With most people displaced globally now in middle income countries (79% of total) and low availability of national resources to respond to the needs of refugees in many of the major refugee-hosting countries, these new financing mechanisms signal a positive shift towards greater global responsibility sharing and support for host countries.</p>\n<h3><strong>Clear opportunities for improving data and financing</strong></h3>\n<p>Building on these new initiatives as a first step, a tailored and diverse set of financing instruments must be deployed to support host countries in meeting the immediate and longer-term needs of refugees.</p>\n<p>The UN Summit, <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/p/io/c71574.htm\" target=\"_blank\">President Obama\u2019s Leaders\u2019 Summit on Refugees</a> and the delivery of the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework present landmark opportunities to achieve this and address the gaps in poverty data by strengthening commitments and providing support to host countries in this area.</p>\n<p>The commitment to \u2018improve data collection\u2019 and strengthen the role of national authorities with the agreed draft <a href=\"http://www.un.org/pga/70/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2015/08/HLM-on-addressing-large-movements-of-refugees-and-migrants-Draft-Declaration-5-August-2016.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Outcome Document for the UN Summit</a> (paragraph 2.19) provides the broader framework in which efforts to strengthen poverty data on refugees can be achieved.\u00a0 Yet, for this to be put into practice, such commitments must be explicitly reflected in the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework and subsequent Global Compact on refugees.</p>\n<p>Photo credit: <a class=\"owner-name truncate\" data-rapid_p=\"30\" data-track=\"attributionNameClick\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/jordibernabeu/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Go to Jordi Bernabeu Farr\u00fas's photostream\">Jordi Bernabeu Farr\u00fas</a></p>\n<div class=\"view attribution-view requiredToShowOnServer clear-float photo-attribution\" id=\"yui_3_16_0_1_1474637918487_808\">\u00a0<strong><br/>\n</strong></div>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Lost in translation: Why joined up data matters at...", "author": [], "format": "Innovation blogs", "date": "19 Sep 2016", "description": "Despite the immense potential in \u2013 and amount of \u2013 data in international development, collecting and analysing this information in a meaningful and holisti", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/lost-translation-joined-data-matters-national-level/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"><p>This is a guest blog written by Danny Walker.

This this will require joining up data for the development community, as well as joining up the technical standards that they engage with and use.</p>\n<p>If you search for population growth rates worldwide, you may find something interesting: three distinct data sources. Furthermore, these sources \u2013 the World Bank\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.GROW\" target=\"_blank\">World Development Indicators</a>\u00a0(WDIs), the Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2002rank.html\" target=\"_blank\">World Factbook</a>, and the United Nations\u2019\u00a0<a href=\"https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/\" target=\"_blank\">World Population Prospects</a>\u00a0\u2013 all have slightly disparate numbers.</p>\n<p>Dig a little deeper, and you\u2019ll find something even more interesting \u2013 even surprising, depending on your statistical experience. These three data sources are themselves derived from a range of distinct yet, at times, overlapping sources. Digging into\u00a0<a href=\"http://databank.worldbank.org/data/reports.aspx?source=2&amp;type=metadata&amp;series=SP.POP.GROW\" target=\"_blank\">WDI metadata</a>, for example, shows that the top-line national population numbers are based on:</p>\n<div class=\"mythemes-sh-list ordered circled medium\">\n<ol>\n<li>\n<div>United Nations Population Division.

At Development Gateway (DG), we\u2019ve\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.developmentgateway.org/2016/08/09/tangled-web-we-weave/\" target=\"_blank\">explored before</a>\u00a0how differences in data compilation can cause challenges. When we\u2019re talking about joining up data \u2013 in this case, surveys \u2013 varying sources often means varying methodologies, and limited comparability. Barriers to joining up survey data can include:</p>\n<div class=\"mythemes-sh-list unordered circled medium\">\n<ul>\n<li><i class=\"mythemes-icon-mythemes-inbox\"></i>\n<div>varying sample sizes</div>\n</li>\n<li><i class=\"mythemes-icon-mythemes-inbox\"></i>\n<div>different topical focus areas</div>\n</li>\n<li><i class=\"mythemes-icon-mythemes-inbox\"></i>\n<div>survey time intervals</div>\n</li>\n<li><i class=\"mythemes-icon-mythemes-inbox\"></i>\n<div>ranges of data-gathering techniques and technologies. (This interoperability barrier has significant implications, particularly at the national level.)</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>For national statistical offices and other data-gathering agencies, the myriad local, bilateral and multilateral organisations collecting data \u2013 often in parallel \u2013 can lead to additional interoperability challenges. Incentives for coordination across data producers are weak; it\u2019s often more expedient to create your own fit-for-purpose system than try to build consensus around interoperability. This expediency often leads to investments in standalone data-gathering mechanisms and platforms, rather than a government-led joint system.</p>\n<p>DG\u2019s research has also shown that, too often, development actors prioritise bottom-up reporting, instead of front-line data relevance. This leads to heavy local level data gathering burdens and information with limited value for service delivery. An\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.developmentgateway.org/2016/03/03/results-indicators-costs-benefits/\" target=\"_blank\">example</a>\u00a0from our work in Tanzania follows:</p>\n<p>Our friend \u2026 founded and operates an HIV clinic that serves hundreds of patients. [He] gets funding from multiple donors, and as a result, has to fulfil a number of indicator reporting requirements. This often means his staff must fill out multiple (yet similar) reporting templates.</p>\n<p>To give an example of these donor requirements, the doctor spoke at some length about the HIV prevalence indicators that he must report to donors, and about how he instead needs data about HIV incidence to ensure his clinic\u2019s effectiveness.</p>\n<p>[The] doctor\u2019s point is pretty clear. In addition to collecting and reporting donor reporting requirements \u2026 his staff also must collect and record separate data to ensure the clinic\u2019s effectiveness.</p>\n<p>So what\u2019s to be done? As part of DG\u2019s<a href=\"http://www.developmentgateway.org/expertise/results/\" target=\"_blank\">\u00a0Results Data Initiative</a>\u00a0we have engaged qualitatively and quantitatively with these issues to better understand data flows and use, and to discover feasible solutions to challenges expressed by local-level data producers and users.</p>\n<p>For the challenge of unsynchronised data gathering, our key\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.developmentgateway.org/assets/post-resources/RDI-PolicyBrief.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">recommendations</a>\u00a0are threefold:</p>\n<div class=\"mythemes-sh-list unordered circled medium\">\n<ul>\n<li><i class=\"mythemes-icon-mythemes-inbox\"></i>\n<div>First, we recommend that the development community works to streamline indicators. This would include assessing the essentiality of each indicator, collaborating with other agencies to reduce duplication and, perhaps most importantly, basing indicators on national government priorities.</div>\n</li>\n<li><i class=\"mythemes-icon-mythemes-inbox\"></i>\n<div>Second, we would recommend that the development community takes a more proactive approach to making data available to government agencies. Without regular and consistent access to data and metadata, it is nearly impossible for governments to aggregate information across data-gathering entities, let alone to compare information across geographical or administrative areas where data-gathering methods may have differed. Only by systematic data and metadata sharing can indicators be both streamlined and compared.</div>\n</li>\n<li><i class=\"mythemes-icon-mythemes-inbox\"></i>\n<div>Finally, for the data revolution to move forward there is a clear need for targeted investments in national data systems and staff. These investments, combined with more strategic coordination and alignment of statistical and results data collection, could represent a significant step forward in having harmonised, actionable data to inform policy and improve lives.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>This blog was written as a part of the <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/projects/joined-data-standards/\" target=\"_blank\">Joined-up Data Standards project</a>, a joint initiative between Development Initiatives and <a href=\"http://www.publishwhatyoufund.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Publish What You Fund</a>.</em></p>\n</div>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Can Brazil leave no one behind?", "author": ["Mariella Di Ciommo"], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "13 Sep 2016", "description": "A Portuguese-language edition\u00a0of this blog is available on the Brasil na Agenda website.

Brazilian diplomacy and civil society worked hard to keep this principle in the agenda and to set high ambitions on ending all forms of poverty, everywhere. Brazil has something to show the rest of the world, having reduced the number of extremely poor people from 23.9 million to 8.2 million in less than 15 years.</p>\n<p>While Brazil should be very proud of this achievement, there is still work to be done. Between 1999 and 2014, progress on extreme poverty has been uneven, with large differences in the rate of progress between states. Acre (8%) and Par\u00e1 (14%) reduced extreme poverty much slower that Goi\u00e1s (84%) and Paran\u00e1 (85%) did, for example (data from Ipea Data: <a href=\"http://www.ipeadata.gov.br\">www.ipeadata.gov.br;</a> calculations by Development Initiatives).<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\"></a> While there are 8.2 million <a href=\"http://data.devinit.org/\">people living in extreme poverty</a>, other forms of poverty and deprivation persist in Brazil.</p>\n<p>Poverty in Brazil has many faces: women, homeless people, children and young people, indigenous people, people living in urban peripheries, fishing communities and rural households.

Data is a key resource to make this happen.</p>\n<p>The Inter-agency Expert Group appointed to discuss Agenda 2030 global indicators has recognised it is important to disaggregate data to appropriately monitor implementation.

Brazil currently chairs the <a href=\"http://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom\">UN Statistical Commission</a> that leads work on the global Sustainable Development Goal indicators, so this vision could be represented there too.</p>\n<p>Brazil is at a crucial moment, in which political legitimacy and national resources are scarce. The progress that Brazil has made towards ending poverty should not be put in jeopardy. Data will not solve all national woes, but can be leveraged as a powerful tool to inform the national policy debate, support evidence-based decision-making and allocate scarce resources in the best possible way.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Progress on pro-poor budgeting in Uganda \u2013 highl...", "author": ["Sophie Nampewo Kakembo"], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "30 Aug 2016", "description": "We recently published the briefing Pro-poor orientation of budgets: The case of Uganda following Uganda\u2019s 2016/17 annual budget, which was presented to Par", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/progress-on-pro-poor-budgeting-in-uganda-highlights-from-a-roundtable-meeting-in-kampala/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"><p><a href=\"https://www.odi.org/publications/6326-evidence-pro-poor-budget-expenditure-pfm-reform\" target=\"_blank\">Pro-poor budgeting</a> has strong implications for redistributing funds towards reducing poverty and targeting people in poverty.

Our analysis explains how far Uganda\u2019s budget is pro-poor, focusing on four components:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Alignment with the national poverty strategies, examining how far budget allocations are consistent with the country\u2019s poverty reduction strategies</li>\n<li>Revenue generation, examining the pressures revenue generation ventures, especially tax revenue, are imparting on people and households with lower incomes</li>\n<li>Debt management with clear sustainability aims and use of the funds for investment</li>\n<li>Poverty reducing spending, providing insights into performance and results.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We conclude that there has been notable progress in areas such as aligning the budget with strategic priorities, focusing majorly on infrastructure development \u2013 which is good for growth, and increasing tax revenue to surpass the fiscal year target. However, there is work to be done particularly on aligning sector development plans to the <a href=\"http://npa.ug/wp-content/uploads/NDPII-Final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">National Development Plan</a>, broadening the tax base and not suffocating the smaller tax payers. For example the threshold for presumptive tax was increased from 50 million to 150 million Uganda shillings, and improving use of borrowed funds to increase returns on investment, especially the social returns, to better incorporate the needs of poor people.</p>\n<p>We discussed our findings in a roundtable meeting with key people from government ministries, departments and agencies, civil society and donors. Here are the highlights.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>We need to strengthen citizen participation in budgeting.</strong> Involving citizens in the budget process provides first-hand information on their needs. Pro-poor budgeting thrives on continued citizen participation as it provides opportunities to raise their concerns. According to the <a href=\"http://www.internationalbudget.org/opening-budgets/open-budget-initiative/open-budget-survey/country-info/?country=ug\" target=\"_blank\">2015 Open Budget Index</a>, citizens\u2019 participation in the budget process stands at 23%, which is low compared with Rwanda (25%), Kenya (33%) and Tanzania (33%) in the region. For pro-poor budgeting to be successful, citizens\u2019 participation should be encouraged from the grassroots, taking care to include groups that can be at risk of marginalisation such as women, young people and older people. Uganda has for years practised bottom-up planning and this now needs to be strengthened through increased sensitisation and mobilisation so more citizens take part in this process.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Recurrent spending including payment for frontline workers should be a focus for funding.</strong> Government spending comprises recurrent and development spending, where recurrent spending refers to payments made for goods and services including salaries and wages, rent, fuel expenses, and interest payments. Development spending refers to expenses that promote economic growth and development \u2013 like infrastructure investments, and that generate income for the government. As the Government of Uganda increases spending on development interventions, more is needed in recurrent spending. Frontline civil servants like doctors, teachers and agricultural service providers who provide direct services such as medical assistance, education, agricultural extension, receive low pay for the services they provide. This contributes to increased cases of absenteeism, sit-down strikes and corruption. Also, facilities such as generators to power theatres at health centres, and ambulances, lack fuel to run them, especially in rural areas.People in poverty rely on social services in areas such as education and health, and therefore their absence affects the development of the poor, putting their lives at risk through increased ill health and illiteracy levels as the services are not readily available. Revising the recurrent spending, including pay for these frontline workers and the facilities they operate, is needed to increase service provision in these sectors.<strong>\u00a0</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>A performance-based budget model is key.</strong> The Uganda government\u2019s focus has been on <a href=\"http://static1.1.sqspcdn.com/static/f/1349767/19599750/1343318039140/Uganda+performance+contracting_budget+reporting\" target=\"_blank\">output-based budgeting</a> \u2013 providing funding to government agencies based on delivery of outputs, which according to participants, has not led to sufficient impact. The government, through the Ministry of Finance, is shifting to <a href=\"http://blog-pfm.imf.org/files/fad-technical-manual-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">performance-based budgeting</a> to enable follow-up, monitoring and implementing resources. This will improve implementation of programmes and absorption of resources, ensuring value for money. In line with this, the Ministry of Finance and the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) are preparing a framework of performance indicators to support and guide roll out of performance-based budgeting.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Uganda\u2019s domestic revenue base should expand.</strong> Domestic revenue mobilisation increases a country\u2019s control over domestic spending, including its allocation to poverty-reducing activities. Despite the efforts and resources put towards analysing the country\u2019s spending, more effort is needed to increase revenue resources to meet the country\u2019s needs. Tax collection and management are essential for development, and Uganda has good standards, shown by its increasing tax revenue \u2013 see our <a href=\"http://data.devinit.org/#!/country/uganda\" target=\"_blank\">Development Data Hub</a>. In the 2016/17 budget, the Uganda Revenue Authority has allocated 8 billion Uganda Shillings to enhance coordination, formalise businesses through licensing and registration, and increase taxpayer awareness and compliance. This will partly be done through the <a href=\"https://www.ura.go.ug/download/CGMS/URA%20JOINT%20OPERATIONS%20WITH%20KCCA%20n%20URSB.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Taxpayer Registration Expansion Project</a>, which aims to gradually formalise the informal sectorThe new <a href=\"http://www.mtic.go.ug/index.php?/doc_download/248-buy-uganda-build-uganda-policy/\" target=\"_blank\">\u2018Buy Uganda Build Uganda\u2019 Policy</a> will also diversify the tax base by supporting the use and consumption of locally produced goods and services. It aims to increase the market base for Uganda\u2019s products and the tax base, for example through introducing charges on trading licences. Such efforts should continue, although they should be closely monitored to ensure they are complementing a pro-poor agenda.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>Curbing illicit financial flows needs to be a priority.</strong> Like many other African countries, Uganda is losing a lot of money in illicit financial flows, especially through trade transactions where exporters under-report the value of their goods and overestimate the value of imports to avoid paying duties. This has contributed to losses in the country\u2019s revenue, amounting to <a href=\"http://www.seatiniuganda.org/press-release-on-illicit-financial-flows/\" target=\"_blank\">US$ 509 million a year</a> between 2000 and 2008. More is needed to strengthen anti-money laundering laws and policies to increase transparency and reduce the flow of these resources.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong>Improvements are needed on \u2018absorptive capacity\u2019.</strong> As well as the government\u2019s efforts to address the problems of poor people in social sectors \u2013 especially health, education, transport, social protection and agriculture \u2013 the government needs to assess the absorptive capacity of people in poverty. Can recipients gain the maximum benefit from the projects and efforts channelled to improving their status through pro-poor budgeting while avoiding wastage?</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><strong>Subnational pro-poor analysis is crucial.</strong> There is crucial need for subnational pro-poor analysis to understand poverty better and accurately assess the impact of resources. Both government and non-government agencies have tried to promote this, for example, our <a href=\"http://data.devinit.org/#!/spotlight-on-uganda\" target=\"_blank\">Development Data Hub</a> provides poverty statistics across districts, which enables comparison among districts and provides opportunity to address the respective problems based on a particular area/region. However, more needs to be done in this area, such as improving the collection and production of disaggregated data, particularly on income quintile, gender, geography, age and disability, and using more recent poverty data, like the findings from Uganda\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.ubos.org/2016/03/24/census-2014-final-results/\" target=\"_blank\">2014 census</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These highlights provide a snap shot of some of the issues that will be key to improving the country\u2019s pro-poor budgeting efforts to get poverty to zero and ensure no one is left behind.

Coordination is critical. Coherent, timely data is a key element of this complex response matrix and at the World Humanitarian Summit in May 2016, 33 of the world\u2019s largest donors and humanitarian agencies\u00a0<a href=\"https://consultations.worldhumanitariansummit.org/bitcache/075d4c18b82e0853e3d393e90af18acf734baf29?vid=581058&amp;disposition=inline&amp;op=view\" target=\"_blank\">committed themselves</a>\u00a0to \u201cidentifying and implementing a shared open-data standard and common digital platform which will enhance transparency and decision-making\u201d. The publishing\u00a0<a href=\"http://iatistandard.org/\" target=\"_blank\">standard</a>\u00a0maintained by the International Aid Transparency Initiative (<a href=\"http://www.aidtransparency.net/\" target=\"_blank\">IATI</a>) was recommended as the vehicle for this effort.</p>\n<p>In preparation for this \u2018Grand Bargain\u2019 IATI has modified its standard to better meet the requirements of humanitarian reporting. These modifications were done in consultation with, amongst others,\u00a0<a href=\"https://fts.unocha.org/\" target=\"_blank\">OCHA\u2019s Financial Tracking Service</a>\u00a0(FTS), the\u00a0<a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/echo/resources-campaigns/online-databases/edris-european-emergency-disaster-response-information-system_en\" target=\"_blank\">European Emergency Disaster Response Information System</a>\u00a0as well as organisations such as the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dec.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">UK Disasters Emergency Committee</a>\u00a0and the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.startnetwork.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Start Network</a>.</p>\n<p>For humanitarian decision-making to be effectively harmonised, data from a variety of sources needs to be joined up. The way in which emergencies are defined and reported is an essential part of this. One improvement to the IATI Standard was thus the inclusion of a new element \u2013\u00a0<a href=\"http://iatistandard.org/202/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/humanitarian-scope/\" target=\"_blank\">humanitarian-scope</a>\u00a0\u2013 which provides a means of accurately defining emergencies and appeals. This is done by specifying a \u2018vocabulary\u2019 \u2013 a globally recognised list of classifications \u2013 which maintains a curated list of codes.</p>\n<p>For a standards body like IATI this raises a number of issues. Here are four considerations\u2026</p>\n<div class=\"mythemes-sh-list unordered circled large\">\n<ul>\n<li><i class=\"mythemes-icon-mythemes-inbox\"></i>\n<div>\n<p>What recognised authority lists (vocabularies) exist?</p>\n<p>No global classification system exists that encompasses all humanitarian emergencies. IATI and OCHA have agreed that the best approach for classifying emergencies is to adopt\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.glidenumber.net/glide/public/search/search.jsp\" target=\"_blank\">GLIDE numbers</a>, a\u00a0Global\u00a0IDEntifier coding system for natural disasters originally developed by the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.adrc.asia/\" target=\"_blank\">Asian Disaster Reduction Center</a>.</p>\n<p>OCHA is a\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.glidenumber.net/glide/public/institutions.jsp\" target=\"_blank\">participating institution</a>\u00a0and as such can generate new GLIDE numbers. Furthermore, there is agreement that the system can be extended to include man-made as well as natural disasters. For GLIDE to be recognised as the key global standard there is a need for all participating institutions to advocate for its adoption by all humanitarian-related information systems</p>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li><i class=\"mythemes-icon-mythemes-inbox\"></i>\n<div>\n<p>How are codes accessed?</p>\n<p>Currently, users of the system are provided with email notifications of changes and can only access the database through manual downloads. This is far from ideal, particularly for data production in the early stages of a sudden-onset disaster.</p>\n<p>For GLIDE to progress it will have to be dynamically accessible by machines. Investment in a robust API that allows for automated discovery and retrieval of codes will be essential.</p>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li><i class=\"mythemes-icon-mythemes-inbox\"></i>\n<div>\n<p>How are codes created and maintained?</p>\n<p>Whenever a new emergency arises a participating institution can create a GLIDE number. If timely data is required urgently in sudden-onset emergencies there is little time for traditional methods of consultation and agreement between participating institutions.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, as IATI\u2019s reporting base grows there will be a need for the registration of local emergencies that may fall beneath the radar of the large participating institutions.<br/>\nThere will thus be a need for a collaborative, technical framework that allows for rapid consultation and approval of new codes.</p>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li><i class=\"mythemes-icon-mythemes-inbox\"></i>\n<div>\n<p>How will users of the data make sense of the codes?</p>\n<p>Humanitarian financial and operational management has been developed in such a way that emergencies are defined and coded by country and year as well as by the disaster itself \u2212 multi-country and multi-year emergencies have new codes generated for each country and year.</p>\n<p>For a user of IATI data to analyse activities related to the West African Ebola epidemic a search would need to be done across 12 unique emergency codes (three countries over four years). The GLIDE number does also include an event-type code and \u201cEP (Epidemic)\u201d is one of them, but parsing identifiers is not easy. IATI will need to consider how to provide a searchable item to improve access to the data.</p>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>IATI is a voluntary standard. It has no power to enforce compliance. It is dependent on the good will of publishers and peer pressure from the humanitarian community as a whole. Improving humanitarian data will require collective efforts from all quarters.</p>\n<p><em>This blog was written as a part of the\u00a0<a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/projects/joined-data-standards/\" target=\"_blank\">Joined-up Data Standards project</a>, a joint initiative between Development Initiatives and\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.publishwhatyoufund.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Publish What You Fund</a>.</em></p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Joining-up data standards requires joined-up leade...", "author": [], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "03 Aug 2016", "description": "This blog was originally posted on\u00a0\u00a0Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data The Guardian newspaper is currently running an online series of art", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/joining-data-standards-requires-joined-leadership/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"><p>This is a guest blog written by Tom Orrell, Senior Advocacy Advisor on Joined-up Data Standards, based at Publish What You Fund\u2019s London office</p>\n</div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p><strong>This blog was originally posted on\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.data4sdgs.org/master-blog/2016/8/3/joining-up-data-standards-requires-joined-up-leadership?platform=hootsuite\" target=\"_blank\">Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data</a></strong></p>\n<p>The Guardian newspaper is currently running an online series of articles entitled\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/the-tech-continent-africas-digital-renaissance\" target=\"_blank\">The Tech Continent: Africa\u2019s Digital Renaissance</a>. Much of the content that has been published to date explores how new technologies can help to overcome specific problems. For example: How can drones be used to deliver medical supplies?</p>\n<p>Whilst investing in innovations such as drone technology in Africa is certainly welcome, it mustn\u2019t detract from the urgent need to build up essential national-level institutional capacity, knowledge and infrastructure across the continent \u2014 including national statistical capacity. Only by doing this will it be possible to establish a timely, accurate and reliable supply of sustainable development data that can be used for decision-making.</p>\n<p>In order for this to happen, countries need to be able to make the best use of data and information that is already available.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the past year, the\u00a0<a href=\"http://juds.joinedupdata.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Joined-Up Data Standards project</a>\u00a0has been exploring how development data from different sources and published to different standards can be joined-up \u2014 made interoperable or more easily comparable with each other. We believe that this is one key way of helping to maximize the value of existing data both for decision-making and accountability.</p>\n<p>Our technical research to date has focussed on a number of areas. We\u2019ve explored how global institutions subdivide the world into geopolitical and socioeconomic groupings and why sectoral classifications used for resource flows are difficult to match with indicator classifications used to describe development impacts, and have investigated data overlaps that occur between competing household surveys and programs.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ve now compiled all our research into a consultation paper that sets out our provisional findings and recommendations on what solutions to interoperability challenges could look like. It has always been an underlying presumption of the project that the challenge of a lack of interoperability between data standards is not really a technical one \u2014 as we\u2019ve shown, the technologies needed to enable interoperability already exist \u2014 but primarily a political one. This is an important point, especially for the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data and those engaging with it.</p>\n<p>Recent years have seen a\u00a0<a class=\"mtli_attachment mtli_png\" href=\"http://juds.joinedupdata.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/CP-Box1.png\" target=\"_blank\">surge in recognition</a>\u00a0of the challenge at the international level. The \u201cWorld That Counts\u201d report, the Transformative Agenda for Official Statistics, Addis Ababa Action Agenda and Open Data Charter, amongst others, all contain references to the need to work towards interoperability between data standards. While this is all welcome, what we\u2019re really interested in now \u2014 as reflected in our consultation paper \u2014 is what these principles mean in practice and how commitments that exist can be converted into action.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most important recommendation that we\u2019ve reached in our consultation paper is that joining-up data standards will require joined-up leadership. As it stands, at the international level, a number of exciting initiatives are taking place that offer excellent opportunities for joined-up leadership on interoperability issues. The work of the Global Partnership itself is really taking off, especially within the working groups. Similarly, within the UN system, the work of the High-Level Group for Partnership, Coordination and Capacity-building for statistics and the Transformative Agenda for Official Statistics is also emerging.</p>\n<p>While these separate developments are very encouraging, we believe that there is a need for an integrated leadership body that covers both official and multi-stakeholder processes to drive the #DataRevolution and Transformative Agenda for Official Statistics forward.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, we are all pursuing a common objective: ensuring that the right data can be accessed and used by the right people at the right time so that they can make better-informed decisions. The commitments on interoperability exist, the technology exists too; all that is now required is political will. For that to be fostered, joined-up leadership will be critical.</p>\n<p>The consultation referred to in this post will be open until the end of April 2017.

By working very closely within the Open Contracting Community, and with a commitment to research, Budeshi seeks to continuously respond to local user needs for engaging and interacting with [OCDS] data; thus contributing to the adoption and advancement of the OCDS. On a broader scale, Budeshi which translates to \u201cOpen It\u201d makes the case for what we stand to achieve by collectively deploying \u201cJoined-up Data Standards\u201d rather than every data-owning and controlling agency working in silos. It is for this reason that we welcome the\u00a0<a href=\"http://juds.joinedupdata.org/a-consultation-on-joined-up-data-standards/\">Consultation Paper</a>\u00a0on Joined-up Data Standards as a starting point on moving the discussion on data interoperability from principles to practice.</p>\n<p>Our need for Budeshi arose from the challenges faced by procurement monitors, who observe and report on the process through which public contracts are awarded and executed. One of such challenges was experienced in monitoring the contracting process for the construction of primary health care centres (PHCs) across Nigeria. At first it was difficult to access procurement records such as plans, tender documents, contract award documents for the construction of these PHCs. After several Freedom of Information (FOI) requests, procurement monitors eventually received some of these procurement records, but then it became difficult to link the data in the plans to the data in the contract award documents because the records at each stage were provided by different Government units, in different formats, and there was no mechanism to link data at any given stage to the next stage. The result of the data incoherence meant that no one process, from project conception to contract award and ultimately to public service delivery, could be adequately followed through from start to finish. Rather, the pre-contract award stage was monitored separately from the project monitoring stage. So although data was gathered throughout the pre-contract award stages, it did not provide any utility for finding out whether executed contracts were good value for money or were built based on identified needs and specifications at the stage of project monitoring.</p>\n<p>Expectedly, the inability to link data across stages continued to affect monitoring results because it was impossible to uniquely identifying any contracting process and its specific features from conception to eventual service delivery. It was impossible to compare budget estimates to eventual contract awards, to compare PHCs with the same specifications or to generate red flags that could prevent project failure or to link contracts that have the same budget source. The efficacy of having a legal provision for citizens to observe and report on every procurement process did not seem to have any effect since the data trail was not clear enough to be followed.</p>\n<p>Given our familiarity with the challenge of data incoherence, we very quickly recognized the value of the Open Contracting data standards to changing this narrative. And so by developing our local platform called Budeshi, we have been able to demonstrate what a more integrated contracting process would look like. For procurement monitors, this means that more meaningful monitoring exercises can be achieved.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Budget.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-15503\" height=\"212\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Budget-320x212.png\" srcset=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Budget-320x212.png 320w, http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Budget-768x512.png 768w, http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Budget-555x370.png 555w, http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Budget.png 975w\" width=\"320\"/></a></p>\n<p>However, Budeshi as a standalone independent platform cannot be sustained if the systems that generate data on public contracting do not support its existence. Public contracting data is generated from the public sector, whose duty it is to provide public services. In fact, the rigour of having to request for data and then convert it to the OCDS before any meaningful monitoring can be undertaken is indication that the reforms required to ensure data coherence go deeper than deploying a civic tech platform.</p>\n<p>Thus, we keep reminding ourselves that Budeshi was primarily set-up to demonstrate to the Nigerian Government and to every other Government that so desires, how and why the OCDS serves as a useful framework to link budget and procurement data to public services. Budeshi was never intended to take over the responsibility of Government and if data would support Government decision making, coherence and interoperability of data is a necessary step that must be adopted within the public sector. And it is in the adoption and implementation of the OCDS within Government that Budeshi derives its true success. Whilst implementation of the OCDS is yet to be achieved in the public sector, we are holding the Government to its commitment to fully implement the OCDS.</p>\n<p>The implementation of the OCDS is only representative of a broader public sector need for data interoperability; and the consultation paper on Joined-up Data Standards is a timely reminder that data would better support sustained development when it is capable of serving both local needs and feeding into larger, more global data structures.

But should this be the top priority in the data revolution?</p>\n<p>In countries where statistical capacity and resources are scant, trade-offs between the need to report internationally on SDG progress and to develop information systems that meet domestic needs will inevitably take place. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that whole new reporting systems are needed for SDG reporting at international, national and even subnational levels. At the international level, the task of producing a set of coherent SDG indicators to measure progress continues. Meanwhile, in the poorest parts of the world, civil registration and vital statistics systems don\u2019t yet exist \u2014 at least not in a form that can guarantee the production of timely and reliable information that can be used for decision-making and planning.</p>\n<p>At national and subnational levels in the world\u2019s poorest countries, basic challenges in civil registration and data collection are having real and serious adverse consequences on people\u2019s lives.<br/>\nTake the case of birth registration for instance. In northern Togo, having a birth certificate is a prerequisite of sitting end of primary school exams. However, until recently, having a birth certificate in northern Togo was not a given. Indeed, based on the author\u2019s experience of\u00a0 compiling data on why children didn\u2019t have birth certificates, a common reason given by parents was \u201cthe termites ate it.\u201d</p>\n<p>The effect of this loss of a vital registration document was that thousands of citizens were in effect invisible to their government and therefore unable to complete their education.</p>\n<h4>We need to reassess what data we need and act accordingly</h4>\n<p>The use of rapid assessments or household surveys to identify unregistered children consumes immense amounts of time and money. It seems logical then that investing in the digitisation of registers and data repositories would be more cost-effective and sustainable in the longer-term. Challenges such as the one described above are often unknown to, or overlooked by, international policymakers and this is a serious problem.<br/>\nTurning to the SDGs, intergovernmental bodies are responsible for designing the majority of data standards. As such, many of these standards are focussed primarily on serving particular institutional needs for data, which do not always align with needs of those in developing countries. For example, although monitoring progress towards the SDGs shows the overall progress at a national level, it gives little information on the state of a country subnationally, which is likely to be of more use to national governments.<br/>\nAs we enter the implementation phase of the post-2015 development agenda, there needs to be a fundamental rethink on how data will be gathered and information generated to measure development outcomes at national and subnational levels if, truly, no one is to be left behind.</p>\n<h4>The SDGs should catalyse societal change, not require broad changes to measure them</h4>\n<p>Whilst the post-2015 agenda is undoubtedly a massive opportunity \u2014 in that it places the onus on states to measure their own development \u2014 international organizations and donors need to be careful not to fall into the trap of spending hundreds of millions of dollars on developing mechanisms that meet the reporting needs of the SDG framework itself. Rather, the SDG framework needs to act as a catalyst for the development of sustainable and effective information systems at national level around the world. We need to develop systems that meet the domestic needs of developing states; just as statistical offices in the West first and foremost serve their own domestic needs. Should the needs of the SDG framework really be prioritised over those of data users in-country?</p>\n<p>The answer to this question doesn\u2019t necessarily need to be binary. The SDG framework itself can deliver for the world\u2019s poorest, it just needs to be approached from the right angle. As a first step, the myth that more data will miraculously result in better usability needs to be dispelled. Even within the United Kingdom, a third of the data sets found on the U.K. government\u2019s open data portal have never been used.</p>\n<p>Instead, focussing on enabling greater comparability and interoperability between data that already exist could be a step in the right direction.<br/>\nFor this to happen, two changes are needed: First, new data standards need to be carefully thought-through to ensure that they are complementary to what already exists, rather than mere duplications; and, secondly, the focus needs to be on enabling greater interoperability between data and comparability between datasets that already exist in order to maximize their usability.</p>\n<h4>International institutions must respond to national needs</h4>\n<p>Interoperability is not a technical challenge. What is needed is a fundamental shift in the behavior and the modus operandi of international organizations. Interoperability is therefore a political problem at heart. Those involved in policymaking at the international level need to take a far more holistic approach to the way they develop SDG reporting tools, by mapping out and considering all existing data sources.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, in order for no one to be left behind, data needs to be useable by people at the national and subnational levels. For this reason, it is imperative that the SDG framework is treated as a means to an end, rather than as an end in itself.</p>\n<p><strong>SDG analysis in practice</strong></p>\n<p>Our own analysis of the SDG framework shows that early attempts to set indicators for SDG 3, on good health and well-being, did not take full advantage of perfectly viable and well-respected existing sources of data such as the World Health Organization Indicator and Measurement Registry. As a result, nine indicators that had no previous data history or methodology attached to them were suggested. Whole new systems would have to be put in place to capture data for these new measures. To avoid situations like this, coordination mechanisms are needed and the process must be open, transparent and include voices from standard-setters, data producers and users from around the world.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_784\"><em>This blog was written as a part of the\u00a0<a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/projects/joined-data-standards/\">Joined-up Data Standards project</a>, a joint initiative between Development Initiatives and\u00a0<a class=\"js-track-clicks\" href=\"http://www.publishwhatyoufund.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Publish What You Fund</a>.</em></div>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Tracking the Sustainable Development Goals at vill...", "author": ["Angela Kageni"], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "21 Jul 2016", "description": "Is SDG tracking best done at village level?

The MDGs provided a set of eight goals, each with specific targets and indicators to track the world\u2019s progress on development issues. These were backed by a multitude of international commitments to address certain components of the MDGs and to direct financing and technical support towards specific areas identified by the goals. There were some key successes, such as a 66% increase in official development assistance in the period 2000\u20132014<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a> and a reduction of the total number of people living in poverty. However, many countries failed to meet a number of the MDGs. The most common reason given for the poor performance of a country against the MDGs was that the targets were not well designed for their contexts, such as differences in countries\u2019 initial levels of development, or what resources and capacity for change they possessed. Crucially, many targets lacked reliable, complete data for comparative baselines with which to track progress.</p>\n<p>Some critics feel that the SDGs risk similar pitfalls. This is because we are still faced with some of the same big challenges, such as the lack of reliable data or a clear consensus on indicators and methodologies for measuring progress over time. There are also critics who are concerned that while the SDGs have a higher aspiration to <em>leave no one behind</em>, the process for achieving the SDGs has a high chance of maintaining a \u2018top-down\u2019 approach that the MDGs had.</p>\n<p>As development actors, governments and the rest of the world make sense of the practical implications of the SDGs, there is an opportunity for communities and citizens to take the initiative and generate data that makes sense to them and helps address real-life, real-time problems. The data generated to inform national-level processes is highly consolidated and is often far removed from the lived experiences people gain in their local areas. This is why national data is barely used to inform the implementation of development programmes at the levels that would be most useful to citizens. Micro-level data \u2013 data that is specific and detailed \u2013 gives a better picture of the status of villages, households or individuals; it is at these most disaggregated levels that relevant, contextualised targets can be set. The same communities can then initiate practical action to achieve localised priorities. Although such data lends itself no less readily to the sorts of analyses that governments and development partners are used to, it will take a while before national systems are sufficiently organised to work consistently with micro-level data. But this is an opportunity we cannot afford to miss.</p>\n<p>It seems logical that data collected at community level has a vital part to play in monitoring progress against SDG targets. Such data speaks best about people and their immediate needs. Subnational data could greatly enrich national statistical systems, help reflect realities and priorities at the grass roots, make action more relevant, and strengthen citizens\u2019 ownership of, and participation in, generating and implementing solutions.</p>\n<h3>Our learnings from localising the SDGs in Kenya</h3>\n<p>Francis Kariuki, a local chief, and the residents of his community in Lanet Umoja (in Nakuru County in Kenya) have done work that proves the usefulness of community generated data in tracking progress against the SDGs. Under the Global Goals for Local Impact project, run by the <a href=\"http://www.openinstitute.com/\">Open Institute</a>\u00a0with technical and financial support from Development Initiatives, the Lanet Umoja community has been collecting data to inform their own development plans since September 2015. The community agreed to track key issues affecting their day-to-day lives: poverty; health; education; gender inequality; clean water and sanitation; security; electrification; and the use of Twitter (a communication tool for the Chief and the citizens). The Chief and the citizens are using mobile data collection and other techniques, and are having the data digitised.</p>\n<p>The Lanet Umoja community\u2019s areas of focus coincide with the following SDG goals:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Lanet-Umoja-goals.png\"><img alt=\"Lanet Umoja goals\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11442\" height=\"146\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Lanet-Umoja-goals.png\" width=\"693\"/></a></p>\n<p>The data, collected from more than 10,000 households (which is different from the official statistics data, which suggests that there are 7,500 households) will be made available via an online dashboard. Here are some examples of the preliminary findings:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Lanet-water.jpg\"><img alt=\"Lanet water\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-11456\" height=\"370\" sizes=\"(max-width: 555px) 100vw, 555px\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Lanet-water-555x370.jpg\" srcset=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Lanet-water-555x370.jpg 555w, http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Lanet-water-320x212.jpg 320w\" width=\"555\"/></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Lanet-health.jpg\"><img alt=\"Lanet health\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-11457\" height=\"370\" sizes=\"(max-width: 555px) 100vw, 555px\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Lanet-health-555x370.jpg\" srcset=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Lanet-health-555x370.jpg 555w, http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Lanet-health-320x212.jpg 320w\" width=\"555\"/></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Lanet-education.jpg\"><img alt=\"Lanet education\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-11458\" height=\"370\" sizes=\"(max-width: 555px) 100vw, 555px\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Lanet-education-555x370.jpg\" srcset=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Lanet-education-555x370.jpg 555w, http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Lanet-education-320x212.jpg 320w\" width=\"555\"/></a></p>\n<p>The key learning that has emerged from this community exercise is that it is possible for ordinary citizens with varying levels of literacy to collect useful data disaggregated down to the household level. Another finding is that to maintain interest and ownership \u2013 and keep the data up-to-date and relevant \u2013 the data collection process needs to be integrated within existing administrative systems that enjoy community support.</p>\n<p>For Lanet Umoja, the administrative system that anchored the data collection was the <a href=\"http://www.syokimau.or.ke/sra/Draft_guidelines_for_implementation_of_NYUMBA_KUMI.pdf\">Nyumba Kumi Initiative</a>, a Kenyan initiative set up in 2004 to improve security by encouraging community coordination and action. The initiative has shown that by working together, citizens can maintain a safe and healthy environment \u2013 something of benefit to both individuals and their communities. It is based on a system that divides administrative regions into self-organised clusters of about 10\u201315 households. Clusters are headed by cluster leaders who report to the Chief \u2013 the primary security officer at Kenya\u2019s most disaggregated administrative level. Under this initiative, the cluster leaders and the Chief also monitor social, environmental and health issues that may cause conflict or pose a danger to the community. The national government has given them a legal mandate to collect information useful to the communities\u2019 development projects (so long as it remains within the Chief\u2019s locus of control).</p>\n<p>The Nyumba Kumi system made the data collection exercise successful \u2013 gaining almost 100% coverage \u2013 by promoting community ownership of both the data collected and the findings. Because the data was gathered by Lanet residents themselves, it focused on indicators that would make administrators and residents aware of existing problems, and so encourage them to plan how to better address these. For this reason, the initiative ensures the relevance and sustainability of any resulting development work. The data the citizens chose to collect is helping them target solutions at the household, school or health facility level, which will help to ensure equitable development.</p>\n<p>There are further applications for the results. Lanet Umoja residents and their Chief will use the findings to advise on how the data collected is useful for administrative purposes. They will also be able to make recommendations to resource-allocating government officials as to where certain development work is most needed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\">[1]</a> <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/policy/mdg_gap/mdg_gap2015/2015GAP_PR_EN.pdf\">http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/policy/mdg_gap/mdg_gap2015/2015GAP_PR_EN.pdf</a></p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Sharing government data in Nepal", "author": [], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "27 Jun 2016", "description": "Open Nepal is a network, supported by Development Initiatives, to promote more effective development through the increased sharing and use of data.

Various government agencies have released datasets through online <a href=\"http://opennepal.net/blog/budding-open-government-initiatives-nepal\" target=\"_blank\">platforms</a>, allowing Nepalese civil society to undertake a number of <a href=\"http://opennepal.net/blog/going-glocal-assessing-openness-nepals-government-data\" target=\"_blank\">assessments </a>on the openness of such data.</p>\n<p>But there remains a gap between the availability of open government data and its positive impact on development. Even in countries ahead of the curve, such initiatives have at times failed to provide value. There has not, for example, always been a strong enough buy-in from government, a broad enough range of civil society stakeholders in their development, or sufficient attention paid to the needs and interests of data users. So what do people in Nepal think now about the potential for open government data?</p>\n<p><strong>Recommendations from those inside government </strong></p>\n<p><strong>By Joshua Leslie</strong></p>\n<p><em>\u201cPolicy [on open government data] must be focused on development outcomes rather than only supply side outcomes for meaningful change to occur\u201d </em>\u2013 Nepali Government Civil Servant at the Second United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs Workshop in Kathmandu, Nepal</p>\n<p>Over the past few years, the idea of sharing government data in an accessible, machine-readable format as open government data has gained traction among both civil society and government. Particular progress has been seen in recent months, with a number of events channeling discussion and innovation on the topic. From our conversation with various government representatives at these events, we have gathered key messages on open government data becoming a reality in Nepal.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>The concept of open government data must be adapted to the Nepali context</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Nepal has its own unique culture and longstanding set of norms, and government officials expressed a concern that sometimes new concepts from external actors could be seen to challenge this. When it comes to increased sharing of government information, such as finance and performance data, officials explained that changing the culture within government to support this could be slow. For the concept of open government data to be a success in Nepal, the officials explained that it needs to be seen by the masses as fitting within the country\u2019s culture rather than challenging it. As such, steps need to be taken to ensure that the sharing of government data is understood within the cultural context and communicated in a way that people can relate to.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Open government data will not happen if Nepal\u2019s elders are excluded from the conversation</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The demand for open government data demonstrated by the youth of Nepal was welcomed by government officials; however, it was expressed that, unless there is support from the elders in positions of power, open government data will not become a reality in Nepal. To ensure the supply of data into the hands of tomorrow\u2019s change-makers, there needs to be encouragement and knowledge-sharing with the older generation. Synergy between the two groups has to be incubated to ensure the success of open government data.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>A legal framework to backstop open government data can support its success </strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>\u201cIn my opinion, to make open government data a success in Nepal the National Planning Commission has to enlarge the legal policy on open data\u201d </em>\u2013 Krishna Hari Baskota, Chief Information Commissioner at the National Information Commission</p>\n<p>Government officials stated that incorporating concepts of open government data within a legal framework could help lay the foundation for its success in Nepal. One potential way of achieving this would be by amending the Right to Information Act, 2007, to include provisions around the proactive release of such a resource. Officials felt that open government data and RTI have fundamentally similar goals in that they both aim to improve access to information for citizens. Thus, through amendments to the RTI Act, open government data principles could be expeditiously implemented into Nepal\u2019s legal framework.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Champions working on open government data must be encouraged and supported</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>To facilitate the realisation of open government data\u2019s many potential benefits, government officials supported the idea of identifying champions to promote the concept \u2013 both inside and outside of the government bureaucracy. They felt that champions are important in helping set the agenda and teaching those that do not understand the importance of open government data. Highlighting the good work done by individuals or institutions will help ensure that the relevance and intent of this resource is properly demonstrated.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>Better information management is necessary if government data is to be shared</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>There appeared to be a high level of buy-in from government officials regarding the use of modern technical systems to enable management and sharing of government data. It was felt that, unless there was adequate technical and human infrastructure, open data would not be achieved regardless of the legal framework created. Government officials expressed that an open data portal and information management system would have to be created if government data is to be proactively disclosed in an open format.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong>Demonstrating use of government data within government will be needed to encourage use by others </strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>\u201cExamples of successful data use in Nepal have to be demonstrated, so that people know what data the government should provide and can request it\u201d</em> \u2013 Krishna Hari Baskota, Chief Information Commissioner at the National Information Commission</p>\n<p>The officials were clear that, unless open government data is supported and used within government, its desired effects will be inconsequential. If better and more open data is a key tenet of sustainable development, then those who are in a position to influence policy must understand the benefits of using data, advocate for it to be opened and show that they are using it. In addition, officials called for civil society to support government by demonstrating the use of open government data.</p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><strong>Civil society must be equipped with the intentions and skills to use government data</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>\u201c</em><em>The elephant came through, but its tail got stuck\u201d</em> \u2013 Nepali proverb</p>\n<p>Proper technological capabilities and technical skills were deemed necessary by government officials to make open government data useful to civil society. To ensure civil society gains the skills to re-use data, its current capability of analysing and using data has to be properly understood.</p>\n<p>These seven messages from government officials are important for those outside of government looking to promote the concept and progression of open government data in Nepal. Bringing government priorities together with civil society priorities on this agenda will help inform the steps taken towards making open government data a reality in Nepal.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommendations from those outside government</strong></p>\n<p><strong>By Pavitra Rana</strong></p>\n<p><em>\u201cWe need more data sharing from government, but if this is to lead to change in Nepal we need to make sure the data released responds to the needs of citizens, and that we are well positioned to know how to use it\u201d </em>\u2013 A civil society organisation (CSO) representative at a recent workshop with the National Information Commission in Kathmandu</p>\n<p>Although still a relatively new idea in Nepal, the concept of open government data and its potential to be shared in an accessible, machine-readable format to deliver change is receiving increasing interest in civil society. At a series of recent events in Kathmandu, we spoke with a wide range of representatives from civil society groups to better understand their concerns, motivations and suggestions for the future of open government data. The following presents seven key messages from civil society:<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>The sharing of open government data must respond to the information needs of the user</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>\u201cIf open government data is meant to help us to better plan, monitor and engage with government, then it needs to be the right data to allow this\u201d </em>\u2013 a CSO Representative</p>\n<p>A number of civil society representatives were aware of experiences in other countries, where the content of data releases by government had not necessarily met needs. Representatives understood the importance of avoiding top-down releases of data that were irrelevant to those who might want to use open government data. To ensure data is useful, it is crucial to first understand who the users are, what they are trying to achieve, how data could be beneficial to them, and, therefore, what data is needed. There is a clear message from civil society that users need to be involved with all efforts to create open government data in Nepal.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>For open government data to lead to change in Nepal its capacity for use needs to be built</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>\u201cOpen government data will not bring improvements in how development is done today in Nepal unless it is used\u201d </em>\u2013 Ambika Osti, <a href=\"http://nalibeli.org/index.php/%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%96%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF_%E0%A4%AA%E0%A5%83%E0%A4%B7%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A0\" target=\"_blank\">NaliBeli </a></p>\n<p>Developing skills and capacity of the users to access, use and analyse open government data was deemed essential by civil society representatives. Especially, for it to be valuable in building new and innovative solutions for effective development in Nepal. They are positive that efforts to improve the skills of intermediaries, such as themselves and journalists, to translate data into information would be helpful. However, data literacy in Nepal is still considered to be low and more government support to strengthen efforts to increase this is needed.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>The roadmap for open government data must be Nepali-led</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>\u201cThe agenda needs to be owned by us and we need to make open government data what it needs to be for our own unique country context\u201d </em>\u2013 Nikesh Balami, <a href=\"http://np.okfn.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Open Knowledge Nepal</a></p>\n<p>To successfully implement open government data in Nepal, civil society representatives believe endorsement of its concept by the national government is critical. Once the government \u2018owns\u2019 this concept, it must engage local civil society throughout the process of implementation.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Nepal must learn from others\u2019 experiences of open government data as well as share its own lessons</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>\u201cLearning from the experiences of other countries helps us understand what works and what doesn\u2019t in a particular scenario\u201d </em>\u2013 Arun Karki, <a href=\"http://datajournonepal.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Centre for Data Journalism Nepal</a></p>\n<p>To assess both favourable and unfavourable conditions for open government data, civil society representatives regarded lessons from others\u2019 experiences as a great tool. Learning from international best practices and local experiences in Nepali civil society was seen as vital to ensuring the nation builds on existing efforts rather than starting from scratch. Open government data activities in Nepal have been taking place in various disguises \u2013 through, for example, public finance management, local governance and local budgeting \u2013 which could be taken to the next level by learning from other innovative open government data models worldwide. It was also felt important that we share our learning to support others.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>For open government data to be of benefit to Nepal it must be inclusive</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Civil society representatives expressed that efforts to promote open government data needed to include all agencies within government. Furthermore, they highlighted that issues across different sectors \u2013 such as education, health, water, natural resources and energy \u2013 must be addressed to build shared solutions. For open government data to be an effective tool for development, it should address everyone\u2019s needs irrespective of geography and demography. Indeed, it needs to be accessible to all parts of the country, not just Kathmandu, and all communities, not just the elite.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong>The data shared must be relevant to our national goals</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>\u201cOne size does not fit all!

In reaction to local demand for information, our partner in Kathmandu, the technology organisation\u00a0<a href=\"http://younginnovations.com.np/\" target=\"_blank\">Young Innovations</a>, established the\u00a0<a href=\"http://earthquake.opennepal.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Earthquake Response Transparency Portal</a>. The portal aims to provide accessible and usable data and information on the availability of resources for the earthquake response, and how they are being used. It was populated with openly available data from sources such as the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Financial Tracking Service (FTS), Prime Minister\u2019s Disaster Relief Fund, media announcements and data published to the <a href=\"http://www.aidtransparency.net/\" target=\"_blank\">International Aid transparency Initiative (IATI) Standard</a>.</p>\n<p>However, these sources capture substantial information on only the resources being put <em>into</em> the system. This is a vital first step but not the full picture.</p>\n<h4><strong>Traceability: The cornerstone of an efficient, effective and accountable response</strong></h4>\n<p>The UN Flash appeal launched to coordinate and fund the international response to the Nepal earthquake is still only 67% funded, meaning one-third of needs identified in this appeal remain unmet a year after the disaster. This is not uncommon; in 2015, only\u00a0<a href=\"https://fts.unocha.org/reports/daily/ocha_R21_Y2015_asof___25_April_2016_(02_31).pdf\" target=\"_blank\">55%</a> of all UN-coordinated humanitarian appeals\u2019 needs were met by the end of the year. We also know that significant funds flowed outside the appeal, but we don\u2019t know the full scale of these, nor how the appeals\u2019 financing shortfall translated into a material shortfall of people\u2019s needs being met. As well as contributing to improved accountability, traceable reporting on how resources are used would help improve the planning, coordination and delivery of assistance \u2013 knowing what is being delivered, where, when and by whom can help avoid duplication and ensure resources are appropriately targeted to areas of highest need.</p>\n<p>Current widespread humanitarian reporting practices by international donors and agencies provide information on only the \u2018first level\u2019 recipient \u2013 the first link in the transaction chain. In reality, funds pass through various intermediaries before ultimately being used to provide assistance by organisations active locally (see figures 5.1 and 5.2 of the 2015 <a href=\"http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/report/gha-report-2015\" target=\"_blank\">Global Humanitarian Assistance Report</a> for further information on channels of delivery). In partnership with Young Innovations, Development Initiatives is conducting a traceability study to gather better information on the assistance delivered in response to the earthquake. A number of donors and agencies have voluntarily provided IATI-Standard data on their humanitarian activities and those of their local implementing partners, including critical fields that enable funds to be traced from donor through to the point of delivery. Their data answers many of the questions raised concerning how assistance was delivered.</p>\n<h4><strong>Global relevance</strong></h4>\n<p>While first and foremost this work is intended to support local transparency and accountability efforts in Nepal, the traceability study provides an opportunity to test the potential of IATI to meet an identified global need for improved reporting and traceable resource data in humanitarian crises.</p>\n<p>The findings of the study will be presented at the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul on 23 May, at a side event co-hosted by Development Initiatives entitled \u2018Transparent financing and integrity measures for effective and accountable humanitarian action\u2019. It will also be detailed in our forthcoming report, \u2018Better data for a better response\u2019. These will offer a real-life demonstration of how traceable data can be used to inform and improve the efficiency, effectiveness, coordination and accountability of humanitarian response, and provide a blueprint for the more systematic publishing of traceable data by a wider group of actors in other crisis situations.</p>\n<p>The Earthquake Response Transparency Portal is just the first step in efforts by Development Initiatives and our partner organisation to ensure the transparency of assistance in Nepal following the earthquake. Young Innovations plans to develop this work by supporting government agencies to build on their efforts by establishing a transparent and accountable institutional regime for Nepal\u2019s long-term rebuilding and reconstruction.</p>\n<p>Traceability is dependent on a critical mass of good reporters.

Krishna Hari Banskota, Chief Information Commissioner of the National Information Commission (NIC),\u00a0highlighted their efforts to raise awareness of the benefits of open government data within the bureaucracy of Nepal. He told us that \u201cNIC is sharing news about the home-grown open data initiatives, as well as sharing information on how governments all around the world have adopted openness in their work through learning from the international forums \u2013 such as the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.opengovpartnership.org/2015Summit\" target=\"_blank\">Open Government Partnership Global Summit</a>\u00a0that we had the privilege of attending in October 2015\u2033. The government has so far taken some\u00a0<a href=\"http://opennepal.net/blog/budding-open-government-initiatives-nepal\" target=\"_blank\">modest steps</a>\u00a0to achieve data openness.<strong>\u00a0</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>The government is committed to improving data quality and standards. </strong>Plans by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) to enact a national strategy for the development of statistics will help streamline our national statistical system to improve data quality and standards. This could also help make government data more open to the public. At the onset of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), this move of CBS is particularly important in helping ensure Nepal has the data competency to measure indicators for SDG monitoring and to aid government planning and decision-making.<strong>\u00a0</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Nepal now has open data included\u00a0in government policy.\u00a0</strong>Ananda Raj Khanal, Director of the Nepal Telecommunication Authority, announced that open data will feature in section 12.5.2 of the new draft ICT policy. If passed this policy may help guide how government can improve sharing of data/information using multiple channels and technologies to make it more open, accessible and useable to people. Suman Raj Aryal, Director General of the CBS, noted that efforts to make public data/information open have existed for several years in processes such as Nepal\u2019s Right to Information Act. But policies and rules will only work if they are implemented well, so there will need to be a lot of effort from both the demand and supply sides to translate these policies into action.<strong>\u00a0</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>The government\u2019s commitment to open data is soon to be demonstrated in their planning processes. </strong>Discussion revealed that the National Planning Commission (NPC) plans to open up to the public all the data used for the 14th periodic plan, which is due for release this June/July. If this happens, it could be a major step forward for Nepal in helping increase public participation in the planning process. The community needs to realise the potential of such data to shape their society and thus hold government to account.<strong>\u00a0</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>Data from across government ministries will soon be more available.</strong>The CBS shared its plans to host data from all ministries on its website soon. For a national statistical body that is also considered the steward of Nepal\u2019s data, this is a huge opportunity to build its profile as a government institution taking a lead in embracing open government to facilitate improved access to public data.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong><em>On challenges</em></strong></p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong>Some agencies think we have a long way to go. </strong>Reasons given included the lack of appropriate technological infrastructure and insufficient skills in the government agencies to open up, share and use data. The CBS and NPC also suggested that important preparatory efforts are needed from the government. These include setting up proper data standards to enable data from one source to be joined up with another and defining limits to data openness to ensure that personal data are kept private.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><strong>The government acknowledges that \u201cthere is a deep-rooted culture of hoarding data and information in Nepal\u201d.\u00a0</strong>The speakers from the NIC, CBS and NPC acknowledged that there is not always buy-in to the idea that it is necessary to share information with the public, and this poses a challenge in promoting openness. One speaker suggested that having a specific open data policy in place would help build the practice of proactive sharing and dissemination of public data in open data format, bridging the gap between data supply and demand.<strong>\u00a0</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li><strong>The government feels it is yet to see strong demand for its data. </strong>Krishna Hari Banskota of the NIC underscored the need to stimulate demand for data to improve its supply and called for a louder voice from civil society. \u201cGovernment and citizens as equal partners in development should share equal responsibility in making Nepal\u2019s open data movement a success. In order to improve government\u2019s efficiency in providing data and information, citizens need to actively seek data and information from the government\u201d.<strong>\u00a0</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"9\">\n<li><strong>The government strongly recognises the need for responsible handling of data, especially ethnicity data. </strong>The CBS gave a word of caution on handling data on Nepal\u2019s ethnicities. \u201cIt is likely to pose a challenge if opened up as it could potentially make society prone to various kinds of disputes that are detrimental to the health of our politics, economy and eventually our development as a nation\u201d advised Suman Raj Aryal of CBS. It will be interesting to see which direction the government will take as elsewhere it is recognised that data on ethnicity is vital in understanding access to resources and ensuring that sustainable development efforts \u2018leave no one behind\u2019.<strong>\u00a0</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong><em>On opportunity for civil society</em></strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<ol start=\"10\">\n<li><strong>There is great opportunity for civil society to support government agencies to embrace open data. </strong>There are a number of agencies that have not yet planned for data and information transparency. For example, Nepal\u2019s newest government agency, Nepal Reconstruction Authority (NRA), has not yet considered making earthquake funds transparent \u2013 besides publishing information on the compensation and concessional loan amount for rebuilding houses. While the NRA has not yet firmed up its plans for data sharing, there\u2019s a great need and opportunity for the community to engage with it to express their demand and support.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Open Data Day allowed the data community in Nepal to witness a huge leap in the progress of open data on the government agenda. Having government officials on-board to share their perspectives on broad aspects of open data in the context of their own work and institutions has shifted the discourse from one of civil society to one that is embraced by government. There is still much more to be done, we\u2019ve a long road ahead of us \u2013 particularly in moving the conversation on from supply of open data to demonstrations of its actual use to improve Nepal\u2019s development. For all the challenges, there are many opportunities, and lots of reasons to feel excited about the future of open data in Nepal.</p>\n<p>Next year when we convene again on Open Data Day 2017, we look forward to seeing the progress on these plans and promises coming to fruition.</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "An overview of Kenya\u2019s Single Registry Model", "author": [], "format": "Innovation blogs", "date": "06 Apr 2016", "description": "The launch of Kenya\u2019s Single Registry scheme marks a major step forward in the management & monitoring of social protection in low & middle-income countries", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/overview-kenyas-single-registry-model/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"><p>This blog was originally posted on\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.developmentpathways.co.uk/resources/an-overview-of-kenyas-single-registry-model/\">Development Pathways</a>\u00a0by\u00a0Richard Chirchir, the Senior MIS Specialist at Development Pathways.</p>\n</div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>The launch of Kenya\u2019s Single Registry scheme marks a major step forward in the management and monitoring of social protection in low and middle-income countries. The Registry has enabled the government of Kenya to link together the Management Information Systems (MISs) of five social security schemes (the Old Age Grant, Disability Benefit, Orphans and Vulnerable Children\u2019s Cash Transfer, Hunger Safety Net programme, and World Food Programme\u2019s (WFP) Cash for Assets scheme). Furthermore, the Single Registry is linked to the National Registration database, so that programme beneficiaries can be clearly identified by their national ID number.</p>\n<p>The Single Registry now enables the National Social Protection Secretariat \u2013 based in the Ministry of Labour and East African Affairs \u2013 to access information on all households receiving social security. This enables them to monitor: beneficiaries enrolled against the government\u2019s expansion plan for the national social security system, the number and type of programme each household is benefitting from, the accuracy of beneficiary details, timelines of payments, complaints resolved within established time frames, and consolidated programme costs. Importantly, the Single Registry can capture information on schemes that are designed very differently, including the use of distinct targeting mechanisms.</p>\n<p>The development of the Single Registry is a core component of the WFP\u2019s Complementarity Initiative in Kenya. Over the past five years, Development Pathways has been contracted by, initially, DFID and subsequently, WFP to work with the National Social Protection Secretariat to build the Single Registry. It has involved:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div>Upgrading four of the individual programme-level MISs to robust and scalable web-enabled infrastructure and platforms;</div>\n</li>\n<li><i class=\"mythemes-icon-mythemes-circle\"></i>\n<div>Upgrading four of the individual programme-level MISs to robust and scalable web-enabled infrastructure and platforms;</div>\n</li>\n<li><i class=\"mythemes-icon-mythemes-circle\"></i>\n<div>Enabling the individual MISs to share innovative common services;</div>\n</li>\n<li><i class=\"mythemes-icon-mythemes-circle\"></i>\n<div>Building an automated electronic validation and query service between the Single Registry and the Integrated Population Registration Service (which contains details on 30 million individuals);</div>\n</li>\n<li><i class=\"mythemes-icon-mythemes-circle\"></i>\n<div>Configuring the automatic replication of data between programme level MISs and the Single Registry;</div>\n</li>\n<li><i class=\"mythemes-icon-mythemes-circle\"></i>\n<div>Establishing innovative data visualization tools to engage stakeholders through illustrative dashboards; and,</div>\n</li>\n<li><i class=\"mythemes-icon-mythemes-circle\"></i>\n<div>Developing a geo-spatial mapping interface and a query based reporting framework.</div>\n</li>\n<li><i class=\"mythemes-icon-mythemes-circle\"></i>\n<div>Configuring the automatic replication of data between programme level MISs and the Single Registry;</div>\n</li>\n<li><i class=\"mythemes-icon-mythemes-circle\"></i>\n<div>Establishing innovative data visualization tools to engage stakeholders through illustrative dashboards; and,</div>\n</li>\n<li><i class=\"mythemes-icon-mythemes-circle\"></i>\n<div>Developing a geo-spatial mapping interface and a query based reporting framework.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Kenya\u2019s Single Registry is very different in design when compared to earlier attempts in other countries to develop unified databases. Kenya\u2019s system is essentially a\u00a0<em>warehouse</em>, holding information on all the beneficiaries of the national social protection system, and is continuously updated as individual programme MISs update their information on beneficiaries. For example, it enables the Social Protection Secretariat to know when households have entered or exited schemes, how many people they have paid each month, whether there are complaints about the system and, potentially, update any changes in household composition. However, the information produced depends on the quality of the data entered. The next stage in the development of the Single Registry will be to ensure that all programme MISs can be managed at district level \u2013 through a web-based system \u2013 and that information on beneficiaries can be updated as close to real time as possible. The broader plan is to also bring on board other components of the social protection system such as the National Social Health Insurance scheme and the National Social Security Fund (NSSF).</p>\n<p>The earlier attempts to design Single Registries in other countries have been conceptualised very differently, focusing on developing \u201csingle targeting mechanisms\u201d for all national social protection schemes, rather than holding information on beneficiaries within a single warehouse. These Single Registries list households in the country, who are given a score estimating their level of wellbeing. Social protection schemes then extract from the targeting database a list of the \u201cpoorest\u201d as their beneficiaries. In spite of these, these systems exhibit a range of weaknesses:</p>\n<div class=\"mythemes-sh-list unordered circled normal\">\n<ul>\n<li><i class=\"mythemes-icon-mythemes-circle\"></i>\n<div>They do not hold information on the programmes accessed by beneficiaries, so are not useful for monitoring.</div>\n</li>\n<li><i class=\"mythemes-icon-mythemes-circle\"></i>\n<div>Potential beneficiary households living in poverty may be excluded from benefits, because there is effectively one entry point (i.e. one registration process and one targeting approach).</div>\n</li>\n<li><i class=\"mythemes-icon-mythemes-circle\"></i>\n<div>The databases are rarely updated (often no more than every five years or more). Given that household incomes and consumption change significantly in very short periods of time, this means that single targeting mechanisms quickly become outdated.</div>\n</li>\n<li><i class=\"mythemes-icon-mythemes-circle\"></i>\n<div>In countries that have programmes using very different targeting approaches, the single targeting mechanism is only useful for certain schemes that target the poorest households. So, for example, Brazil\u2019s well-known Cadastro Unico is not used by the country\u2019s largest social security schemes, which are more universal in their targeting, means-test individuals rather than households, or are contributory.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>By not following this simple approach, Kenya\u2019s Single Registry has incorporated many other features (and could, easily, incorporate a targeting database if that were required). Furthermore, if the individual social security programmes are designed and implemented well, the Registry will be highly dynamic, with regular updating. Importantly, it does not oblige Kenya to adopt only one targeting mechanism, but enables the government to use different targeting approaches for schemes that have very distinct objectives. Other countries are also beginning to adopt this approach: Development Pathways is now supporting the governments of Rwanda and Uganda in developing their own Single Registries. We hope that Kenya can become a beacon to many other countries.</p>\n<p><em>This blog was written as a part of the\u00a0<a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/projects/joined-data-standards/\">Joined-up Data Standards project</a>, a joint initiative between Development Initiatives and\u00a0<a class=\"js-track-clicks\" href=\"http://www.publishwhatyoufund.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Publish What You Fund</a>.</em></p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "People in rural areas risk being left behind as ai...", "author": ["Wilbrod Ntawiha"], "format": "Data blog", "date": "22 Mar 2016", "description": "Today we celebrate World Water Day 2016, coordinated by UN-Water as a reminder that water has the power to transform people\u2019s lives.

Therefore this data is indicative of relative funding allocations, with a clear need for donors to improve reporting.</p>\n<h4 class=\"Figureandtableheading\">Figure 2: Rural and urban investments in water and sanitation for 2013 against 2012 global access indicators, constant 2012 prices</h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/World-Water-Day_Figure-2.png\"><img alt=\"World Water Day_Figure 2\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-10468 size-full\" height=\"291\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/World-Water-Day_Figure-2.png\" width=\"611\"/></a></p>\n<p><em>Source: Development Initiatives based on OECD DAC CRS and Joint Monitoring Programme data</em></p>\n<p>Crucially, in rural areas there is relatively low access to improved water and sanitation facilities and higher financing gaps.

This is a real triumph for those advocating for a data revolution for sustainable development as it reflects the increasing significance of innovative approaches and new technologies in producing official statistics.</p>\n<p>This is particularly important for the ambitions of joined-up data.</p>\n<p>At the Open Government Partnership Global Summit in Mexico last year it was\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.aidtransparency.net/news/joining-up-data-standards-post-ogp15-a-need-for-joined-up-conversations\" target=\"_blank\">concluded</a>\u00a0that for interoperability to be built into data systems effectively, standards setters, data producers and data users first need to agree on how to do this and then sustain their engagement on the issue. Together with the transparency and open data communities, there is a clear need for the international statistics community to agree on this as well.</p>\n<p>This year\u2019s High-level Forum on Official Statistics took place just before the official UNSC session. Its themes reflected the new momentum towards a policy dialogue on the data needs for the 2030 agenda and the need for partnerships, innovative approaches and solutions from data experts and producers.</p>\n<p>Early in the Forum, the UN Assistant Secretary-General for Economic Development, Lenni Montiel, made the point that in the coming years states will need to address the issue of how to develop standards to harness the potential of new sources of data. By necessity, this will require a conversation on how to improve interoperability between data standards. This is absolutely right, but also raises an important point: why wait to have that discussion when there is already a need to join up existing standards?</p>\n<p>As our first two\u00a0<a href=\"http://juds.joinedupdata.org/discussion-papers/\">discussion papers</a>\u00a0demonstrate, there is a pressing need for conversations in the official statistics community on how to develop common solutions to the challenges posed by a lack of interoperability between existing standards and datasets. Our\u00a0<a href=\"http://juds.joinedupdata.org/sdgs-dp-1/\">first discussion paper in particular</a><em>,\u00a0</em>concludes that there are two ways of achieving interoperability: by designing interoperability into standards from the outset or by employing an interpreter for existing standards (ie developing tools capable of joining up standards).</p>\n<p>While further work in this area is needed, we are already taking tentative steps to develop the tools needed to realise interoperability. For instance, we recently launched an\u00a0<a href=\"http://juds.joinedupdata.org/thesaurus/\">online thesaurus</a>\u00a0to provide a simple interface for users of our website to build and/or store taxonomies and manage relationships between data concept schemes in an open, publically available space. We will be publishing further discussion papers in the coming months, taking the joined-up data conversation to a range of stakeholders to explore how this work can benefit other sectors.</p>\n<p>A key part of our research and approach as a project is to invite collaboration and feedback from others.

Some of the key issues the international community has been discussing are how best to support countries to increase their revenue mobilisation in progressive and sustainable ways and the role of aid for domestic revenue mobilisation (aid for DRM).</p>\n<p>Aid for DRM encompasses cooperation in areas such as capacity building for revenue authorities, using new technology in revenue collection or financial management, and introducing and enforcing new tax policies. It typically consists of projects that are small in dollar value, but can have transformative effects. Mozambique, for example, was able to more than double real per capita revenue in six years between 2008 and 2013, in part due to the support of the international community for tax reform projects.</p>\n<p>Last year, at the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/esa/ffd/ffd3/\">Third International Conference on Financing for Development</a>\u00a0in Addis Ababa,\u00a0a group of donors, multilateral organisations and developing countries established the <a href=\"https://www.addistaxinitiative.net/\">Addis Tax Initiative</a> and committed to double technical cooperation in \u201cthe area of domestic mobilisation / taxation\u201d by 2020. This important commitment could create strong incentives to increase aid for DRM and ultimately help increase the revenue available to many countries wanting to implement the vision of the SDGs.</p>\n<p>Yet despite the growing importance of this area of cooperation, our understanding of the current situation is patchy, as the systems for reporting ODA spending do not include a mechanism for identifying this component of ODA. In a forthcoming report,[1] we have developed a methodology to address this that identifies relevant ODA projects based on the detailed information on objectives and activities that donors report to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).</p>\n<p>We have identified around 600 aid for DRM projects in 2013, and from within these, almost US$93 million spent on projects that are primarily about increasing revenues (\u2018core aid for DRM\u2019) and US$600 million spent on projects for which revenue mobilisation is one objective among others (\u2018wider aid for DRM\u2019).[2]</p>\n<p>The UK is the largest provider of core aid for DRM, followed by Norway and the EU (Figure 1). The United States is by far the largest provider of wider aid for DRM, followed by Australia and the Asian Development Bank. The largest recipients of core aid for DRM are Tanzania, Afghanistan and Mozambique.</p>\n<h3>Figure 1: Largest providers of aid for DRM</h3>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Make-it-count-why-and-how-to-track-aid-for-domestic-resource-mobilisation.png\"><img alt=\"Make it count why and how to track aid for domestic resource mobilisation\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-10425 size-full\" height=\"878\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Make-it-count-why-and-how-to-track-aid-for-domestic-resource-mobilisation.png\" width=\"1402\"/></a></em></p>\n<p><em>Source: Development Initiatives\u2019 calculations based on OECD DAC.

WP-Stat, the committee that defines how data on official development assistance (ODA) will be reported, is in the process of reviewing <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/officialdocuments/publicdisplaydocumentpdf/?cote=DCD/DAC/STAT(2015)9&amp;docLanguage=En\">how to improve reporting in line with the SDGs</a>.

A purpose code would provide a simple framework for identifying relevant projects and could allow donors to separate the DRM and tax component of wider aid for DRM projects. Such a purpose code would also allow clear benchmarking and monitoring of the commitments made by the Addis Tax Initiative.</p>\n<p>Aid for DRM is an important means by which the international community can help countries increase the revenue they raise. It is an area of ODA that looks set to grow and has the potential to help countries achieve significant gains in the revenues they have available. Taking steps now to provide clarity on the basics of this cooperation \u2013 how much is spent, where and how \u2013 will help retain momentum for the commitments that have been made. And increasing clarity on what is being spent can help shift the focus to the more important question of what impact aid for DRM is having.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</div><div class=\"row--cards\" ng-if=\"post.notes\">\n<div class=\"col-md-12 card m-b--2\">\n<div class=\"card__content bg--light\">\n<h3 class=\"h3\">Notes</h3>\n<div> <p>[1] Aiding domestic revenue mobilisation, to be launched in April 2016</p>\n<p>[2] It is not currently possible to isolate the relevant components of these projects, which often cover a wide array of cooperation related to areas such as public finance management or decentralisation.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Modernising ODA loans: impact of new DAC reporting...", "author": ["Rob Tew"], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "09 Mar 2016", "description": "In part 1 of this blog series, we looked at the rule changes around measuring loan concessionality and some possible implications of these.

This second part examines the possible impact of these changes on the overall levels of official development assistance (ODA) reported by donors.</p>\n<h3><strong>Including repayments of ODA loans in the total aid figures</strong></h3>\n<p>To understand this impact we need to note that the changes in measurement of concessionality are accompanied by a change in the way that loan repayments are treated. Under the new rules, the headline ODA figures will not be adjusted for capital repayments from recipients of loans. Essentially, donors will no longer subtract loan repayments from their headline ODA figures. This may not seem an earth-shattering change, but looking at how this works in practice hints at concerning long-term implications.</p>\n<p>Using 2014 data on ODA from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC) Creditor Reporting System (CRS), we estimated the change in the amount of ODA reported by each donor due to these new rules (see table). It is clear that the rule changes could have a significant impact on headline figures of reportable ODA from some key donors, whether or not the levels of aid transferred to poor countries from these donors actually increases or decreases. Main changes are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Donors who have increased ODA loans in recent years will likely see an overall fall in reported ODA. This is because the reduction in ODA due to the grant element (especially for donors who give loans with a relatively low grant element) covered in part 1 won\u2019t be offset by the rule change related to loan repayments. This is because repayments on recent loans may not have started due to the \u2018grace period\u2019[1]<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\"></a> associated with most ODA loans. <strong>Examples: France, Germany, the EU</strong></li>\n<li>Donors who have a large stock of outstanding ODA loans, with correspondingly large repayment receipts, may see an increase in overall reported ODA levels as capital repayments will no longer be subtracted from reported ODA \u2013 this is especially true if new loans are being given at a relatively high grant element. <strong>Example: Japan</strong></li>\n<li>Donors who do not presently give loans, but who are still receiving repayments on old ODA loans will see an increase in reported ODA levels. <strong>Example: United States</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Effect of new ODA loan rules on donors\u2019 2014 ODA levels</strong></h4>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Modernising-ODA-loans-part-2.png\"><img alt=\"Modernising ODA loans (part 2)\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-10402 size-full\" height=\"609\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Modernising-ODA-loans-part-2.png\" width=\"618\"/></a></strong></p>\n<h4><strong>Risk of incentivising use of loans above grants</strong></h4>\n<p>Importantly for developing countries, therefore, the new rules may, in the long run, incentivise the increased use of loans as a financing tool over grants, as donors seek to maximise headline reportable ODA figures. As we noted in part 1, this could incentivise the use of loans in country contexts where loans may be less appropriate. (The rule changes also make things very confusing for stakeholders who want accurate figures on ODA volumes from certain donors over time, as the new reporting directives are phased in and the old ones phased out. This is a broader aspect of the ODA modernisation project as a whole that everyone will have to grapple with.)</p>\n<h3><strong>One to watch: ODA loans to the private sector and \u2018risk premia\u2019</strong></h3>\n<p>A final important area (still to be fully worked out by the DAC) is ODA loan arrangements that involve the private sector and the related issue of \u2018risk premia\u2019 for donors giving ODA loans. There is some back-story to these \u2018risk premia\u2019: Increasingly, donor countries are keen to use ODA for \u2018catalysing\u2019 or mobilising private investments in development. Some have been pushing to receive recognition for investments made through, for example, development finance institutions and export\u2013import banks, via private sector instruments (PSIs)[2]. These investments in private entities, as they are non-concessional, are not currently reportable as ODA.</p>\n<p>However, the new directives outlined in the of the DAC 2016 High Level Meeting Communiqu\u00e9 indicate that some PSI expenditure, if sufficiently \u2018developmental\u2019, may now count as aid <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/dac/DAC-HLM-Communique-2016.pdf\">(see Annex 1 </a>. This relates to ODA loans in that the Communiqu\u00e9 states that the DAC is working to propose a \u2018risk premium\u2019 in the discount rate to further incentivise use of PSIs by donors, which may have \u2018little or only a purely technical concessionality threshold\u2019. Though we\u2019d need more information to be sure, what this might mean in practice is that donors giving PSI-related funding may be able to count this as ODA, despite the loan having less concessional terms than a straightforward ODA loan to a government. This could have problematic consequences of incentivising fewer concessional loans \u2013 and grants \u2013 to governments, and direct more ODA as a whole to private companies (<a href=\"http://www.eurodad.org/OECD_DAC_HLM_ANALYSIS\">as Eurodad notes</a>). While in principle, incentivising more private investments in sustainable development makes sense given the scale of the investment gap in developing countries, there is a lack of transparency and accountability, with little available evidence of the developmental impacts of PSI-type investments. While the DAC has also begun work to improve reporting at the activity level of PSIs, it seems assessments of the developmental value of PSIs may come down to self-reporting and peer review, which may not allow for enough independent oversight.[3] These reporting standards need to be developed openly and in consultation to ensure that they are robust, transparent and provide the necessary information on developmental (development-effective financing mechanisms should, in principle, stimulate investments that would not otherwise have been made (financial additionality), or influence the business model to follow a more development-friendly approach (operational additionality). There is not yet any common accepted framework for assessing additionality.</p>\n<p>Stakeholders will need to watch closely as the changes are rolled out and reporting guidelines developed, and keep participating actively in the debate.

Attention from commentators has mostly been focused on more controversial elements of the outcome, such as the move to incorporate some <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/investments-in-peace-and-security\" target=\"_blank\">peace and security costs into ODA</a>, and a first attempt from the DAC to set out measurements of effort around \u2018private sector instruments\u2019 (we will blog on this in due course).</p>\n<h4><strong>Rule changes to ODA loans </strong></h4>\n<p>Less attention has been paid to the HLM outcome regarding rule changes to ODA loans. This is partly because the rule changes were first floated in December 2014, and reporting directives are now just being finalised. However, it would be wrong to ignore this issue: loans have formed an increasingly large proportion of ODA in recent years, with gross loan disbursements reaching a new peak of US$42 billion in 2014 (of a total US$160 billion gross ODA). Our <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/oda-loans-tracking-a-growing-source-of-development-financing\" target=\"_blank\">2015 report on ODA loans</a> found that half of all developing countries have seen loans grow faster than grants between 2005 and 2013, while some \u2013 including Egypt, Kenya, Myanmar and Turkey \u2013 saw an increase of over 500% in ODA loans during that time. Now the new rules are more or less in place, it may be time to take stock of the changes; particularly for stakeholders from developing countries, or for those interested in the influential handful of DAC donors \u2013 Japan, France and Germany \u2013 who provide over 90% of total bilateral DAC loans. (Among multilateral bodies, the EU and the International Development Association of the World Bank are the main sources of multilateral loans, providing two-thirds of gross loan disbursements.)</p>\n<p>In this two-part blog series, we look at likely trends, impacts and implications of the new rules on loans in three key areas.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Changes in the calculations of loan concessionality (below)</li>\n<li>Including repayments of ODA loans in the total aid figures (<a href=\"http://devinit.org/modernising-oda-loans-impact-of-new-dac-reporting-rules-part-2/\" target=\"_blank\">part 2</a>)</li>\n<li>One to watch: ODA loans to the private sector and \u2018risk premia\u2019 (<a href=\"http://devinit.org/modernising-oda-loans-impact-of-new-dac-reporting-rules-part-2/\" target=\"_blank\">part 2</a>)</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><strong>Changes in the calculations of loan concessionality </strong></h3>\n<p>We\u2019ve already <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/much-aid-worth-explaining-dacs-proposed-changes-measurement-oda\">blogged in detail</a> on the previous method used to count ODA loans and the perceived problems with it. Essentially, drivers for the rule changes were a) to counter criticisms that reporting allowed donors to overstate the benefit of ODA loans (particularly less concessional loans) and b) to incentivise more and cheaper loans to the countries in most need, by providing extra \u2018credit\u2019 for donors who undertake these more \u2018risky\u2019 loans. The balancing act for the DAC was to avoid disincentivising ODA loan giving to middle income countries (MICs) and, as we argued in <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/oda-loans-tracking-a-growing-source-of-development-financing\" target=\"_blank\">our previous report</a>, they also needed to seek to avoid incentivising loans in country contexts where grants would be more appropriate.</p>\n<p>The changes now agreed to how loans are valued in the ODA statistics are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In future, only the grant element[1] percentage of the loan, and not the full face value, will be counted as ODA. This means loans with a very high grant element will count for more ODA than loans with a relatively low grant element.</li>\n<li>The flat 10% reference rate to calculate the grant element of loans will be replaced. (This 10% rate was a <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/much-aid-worth-explaining-dacs-proposed-changes-measurement-oda\">much-criticised and outdated reference rate</a>, meaning that loans could be \u2018concessional\u2019 enough to count as ODA even if the interest rate of the loan was actually equivalent to commercial market rates.) Instead there will be a range of rates based on the income status of the recipient: 6% for loans to upper MICs, 7% for lower MICs and 9% for low income countries (LICs)/least developed countries (LDCs).</li>\n<li>The current 25% grant element threshold (the level of concessionality needed for a loan to count as ODA) will be replaced with a range of threshold values, also based on the income status of the borrower. It is proposed that, in the case of LICs/LDCs, only loans with a grant element of over 45% should be counted as ODA. For lower MICs and upper MICs the threshold levels will be 15% and 10% respectively.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>A risk to watch closely: the incentive to lend to poor countries rather than give </strong></h4>\n<p>While the changes are a step in the right direction, the impacts need to be carefully monitored because, as noted in <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/oda-loans-tracking-a-growing-source-of-development-financing\" target=\"_blank\">our 2015 report</a> they could perversely incentivise more lending (rather than grant giving) to the poorest countries (as DAC donors will get more overall \u2018credit\u2019 for a loan to an LIC than for a loan to an MIC). New 2014 ODA data compounds this view: there are already two heavily indebted poor countries in the top 10 recipients of ODA loans: Tanzania and Ethiopia. In light of pressure on donors to reach aid targets, this needs to be watched closely: in case the decision to direct more loans to LICs is influenced by a need to increase headline figures of ODA, rather than the appropriateness of loans as an instrument. (It doesn\u2019t appear that any action has been taken to change the rules on counting of debt relief, as we recommended previously.)</p>\n<p><strong>Top ten recipients of ODA loans (2014)</strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Modernising-ODA-loans-part-1.png\"><img alt=\"Modernising ODA loans (part 1)\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10386\" height=\"370\" sizes=\"(max-width: 555px) 100vw, 555px\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Modernising-ODA-loans-part-1-555x370.png\" srcset=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Modernising-ODA-loans-part-1-555x370.png 555w, http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Modernising-ODA-loans-part-1-320x212.png 320w\" width=\"555\"/></a></strong></p>\n<p><em>Source: Development Initiatives based on OECD DAC data</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/modernising-oda-loans-impact-of-new-dac-reporting-rules-part-2/\">Read part 2 of this blog series.</a></p>\n</div><div class=\"row--cards\" ng-if=\"post.notes\">\n<div class=\"col-md-12 card m-b--2\">\n<div class=\"card__content bg--light\">\n<h3 class=\"h3\">Notes</h3>\n<div> <p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\">[1]</a> The grant element is the standard way of measuring how concessional a loan is.

For this, it is critical that the following three points are achieved:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adequate funding should be targeted specifically at gender equality. This necessitates the mobilisation of resources beyond aid \u2013 including those that are public, private, international and domestic.</li>\n<li>Gender-disaggregated data should be available at national and sub-national levels to ensure that such funding is targeted effectively towards addressing the different needs of women, girls, men and boys.</li>\n<li>Donor reporting on gender-related spending continues to improve and plays a critical role in tracking the delivery of gender-related policy commitments and strengthening transparency and accountability. Whilst there are some shortcomings with OECD DAC\u2019s gender policy marker \u2013 particularly regarding the need to systematically review the application of the gender marker throughout the programme cycle \u2013 it does provide a standardised and systematic tool for tracking and comparing donor spending on gender.

Finding a way to talk about standards in a language that is accessible and relevant is an interesting challenge. Taking a broad overview of the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) seemed like a good place to start.</p>\n<p>A data standard is a set of rules by which data is recorded and stored. Standards help us understand the meaning and the significance of the data stored on top of their format. Following this logic, the SDG framework \u2013 with its goals, targets, indicators and methodologies \u2013 is a standard of logically classified data with clear definitions to report it into.<br/>\nDue to its composite nature it is a perfect example of why joining data standards is not only important but also necessary.</p>\n<p>The SDG framework is not new in its architecture or content. This framework depends heavily on the previous Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in terms of its format, classification and even the elements making up the new goals and indicators. Our first port of call was therefore to compare the new with the old to understand similarities and differences. We also looked at the new standards in relation to other existing monitoring standards.</p>\n<p>The Inter-agency and Expert Group on the SDGs (IAEG-SDGs) brought together a range of subject matter and statistical experts to design a set of priority indicators fit for the next 15 years, building out from the MDGs. They needed to take into account what had gone before, what data was and could be available and what the subject-matter experts believe are the most relevant indicators moving forward. This balance is not without challenges as we discovered when looking at child mortality.</p>\n<p>For the past 15 years, child mortality has been monitored through the infant mortality rate (from birth to 1-year-old) and under-5 mortality rate. This timeframe and the importance of the MDGs gave the infant indicator consistent data points in developing countries and a methodology that was fine-tuned over two decades. In the new framework this indicator has been changed to measure the neonatal (0 to 28 days) mortality rate. There are good clinical reasons for this: neonatal rates where they have been recorded are dropping slower than infant rates. However, vital statistics on neonatal deaths from civil registration data are only available for 38 out of 139 developing countries. The lack of a comprehensive data set means it will need to be estimated for the majority of countries. The proposed methodology suggests that this estimation will be based on under-5 data; but the under-5 mortality rate is, in most of these countries, already estimated from the infant rate.</p>\n<p>There is no one-size-fits-all solution to problems like this. This paper is only the beginning of a discussion on the SDGs in the light of other existing standards. We live in a linked world and a joined-up approach will hopefully provide us with a comprehensive and holistic framework for analysis.</p>\n<p><em>This blog was written as a part of the\u00a0<a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/projects/joined-data-standards/\">Joined-up Data Standards project</a>, a joint initiative between Development Initiatives and\u00a0<a class=\"js-track-clicks\" href=\"http://www.publishwhatyoufund.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Publish What You Fund</a>.</em></p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Where did peacekeeping money go in 2014?", "author": [], "format": "Data blog", "date": "03 Mar 2016", "description": "Countries in sub-Saharan Africa received the largest volumes of funding for peacekeeping operations in 2014, reflecting the high levels of conflict and ins", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/where-did-peacekeeping-money-go-in-2014/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>Countries in sub-Saharan Africa received the largest volumes of funding for peacekeeping operations in 2014, reflecting the high levels of conflict and instability experienced in the region.

Funding to the conflict prevention and resolution, peace and security sector has increased by 67% since 2005, reaching a peak of US$3.9 billion in 2009. This peak in funding was largely in response to the crises in Iraq and Afghanistan and a rise in funding to security sector reform (SSR). Funding to SSR increased by US$787 million between 2007 and 2008. During the last decade, \u2018peacebuilding activities\u2019 as a sub-category has consistently received the majority of sector funding (52.5% in 2014).</p>\n<h4>Most ODA on conflict prevention and resolution, peace and security went to peacebuilding activities in 2014</h4>\n<h5>Trends in aid to conflict prevention and resolution, peace and security sub-sectors, 2005\u20132014</h5>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/New-aid-rules-allow-for-the-inclusion-of-a-wider-set-of-peace-and-security-activities.png\"><img alt=\"New aid rules allow for the inclusion of a wider set of peace and security activities\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-10306 size-full\" height=\"789\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/New-aid-rules-allow-for-the-inclusion-of-a-wider-set-of-peace-and-security-activities.png\" width=\"1000\"/></a></p>\n<p>Source: Development Initiatives\u2019 calculations based on OECD DAC\u2019s Creditor Reporting System (CRS) 2014 download.</p>\n<p>Notes: Sub-categories stated are abbreviations from the full categories in the CRS.[1] Abbreviations: SALW, small arms and light weapons; SSR, security sector reform.</p>\n<p>A diverse range of investments and activities can support the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable people, and more evidence is needed on the linkages between investments and outcomes to inform the allocation of resources. Peace and security is a prerequisite for sustainable development; thus, the inclusion of a wider set of non-coercive activities that seek to reduce the risk of violence, build the capacity of law enforcement agencies to provide public safety, and strengthen civilian oversight over partner military forces is an acceptable modification to aid rules if the beneficial impacts on development and poverty reduction can be demonstated. Such activities could, for example, play a role in meeting the critical security needs of vulnerable people in fragile and conflict-affected countries and in the delivery of global policy commitments that focus on the protection of vulnerable groups in such contexts.</p>\n<p>The inclusion of new activities to train partner military forces in the \u2018protection of women in conflict and prevention of sexual and gender-based violence\u2019 will create incentives for governments to deliver on associated commitments set out in the UK-led <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/274724/A_DECLARATION_OF_COMMITMENT_TO_END_SEXUAL_VIOLENCE_IN_CONFLICT.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Declaration of Commitment to End Sexual Violence in Conflict (2013)</a>, which has been endorsed by over 120 countries.</p>\n<p>However, there is a risk that for some donors, depending on how the wording in the communiqu\u00e9 for the High-Level Meeting is interpreted, these changes to aid rules may result in resources being diverted away from activities with a greater development and poverty-reduction focus in favour of those that align to national security and political priorities. The new focus on \u2018preventing violent extremism\u2019 through ODA, which aligns closely with many donor governments\u2019 foreign policy priorities on counter-terrorism, does validate this concern. As a result, the direct impact of ODA on people facing acute poverty and insecurity would be reduced, undermining efforts to meet the ambition set out in the <a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld\" target=\"_blank\">2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development</a> to \u201cleave no one behind\u201d. However, this risk does not apply equally to all donors as there are likely to be differences in the way donors apply these rules to their ODA reporting.</p>\n<p>To ensure that all ODA continues to be development focussed, it is critical that the following three points are achieved.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Donors must demonstrate the development-related impact of all ODA spending decisions.</strong> ODA is a scarce resource. It therefore must be prioritised for supporting activities that have the greatest impact on the livelihoods and security of the poorest and most vulnerable people in the countries and sub-national regions that need it the most. Donors should systematically demonstrate who has benefitted from assistance, where they have benefited, and the impact such investments have had.</li>\n<li><strong>To achieve this, donors must be transparent and report on all ODA spending on peace and security.</strong> This should apply to all government departments that make decisions on the allocation of, and play a role in delivering, ODA-related activities. Timely reporting to the <a href=\"http://www.aidtransparency.net/\" target=\"_blank\">International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI)</a>, across all government departments, will help to achieve this in line with donor promises at Busan in 2011.[2] <a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\"></a>While there are concerns that publishing certain activities to IATI could put staff or populations at risk, a clear policy for deciding which data should be excluded should be developed and by all donor government departments. While some data (such as the names of partners or suppliers in receipt of donor funds) could be excluded for security reasons, this should not prevent other, less sensitive information about the same programme or project from being published. See <a href=\"http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/international-development-committee/dfids-allocation-of-resources/written/28286.html\" target=\"_blank\">Development Initiatives\u2019 submission</a> to the UK International Development Committee\u2019s enquiry on the Department for International Development\u2019s allocation of resources\u2019 for more detailed suggestions on how donors\u2019 cross-government transparency on ODA allocation could be improved through IATI.</li>\n<li><strong>Ambiguous wording outlined in the High-Level Meeting communiqu\u00e9 must be clarified</strong>. Key areas of the communiqu\u00e9 that need further clarification include the following.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>The document states that \u2018intelligence gathering\u2019 cannot be included as ODA; yet, a footnote contradicts this by stating that this does not refer to (and so presumably includes) \u201cpreventative or investigatory activities by law enforcement agencies in the context of routine policing to uphold the rule of law, including countering transnational organised crime\u201d.[3] This footnote implies that national intelligence or \u2018investigatory\u2019 activities would in fact be reportable as ODA, potentially validating concerns that these new rules may result in the diversion of ODA resources away from addressing the needs of vulnerable people as national security priorities are prioritised. More explanation is required on what types of activities fall within the terms \u2018investigatory\u2019 and \u2018countering transnational organised crime\u2019, as well as the ways in which they are development related.</li>\n<li>It also states that \u2018financing for routine civil policing functions\u2019 and \u2018the provision of related non-lethal equipment\u2019 can be reportable as ODA[4] Depending on interpretations, \u2018routine civil policing functions\u2019 could apply to a broad range of activities, including coercive law enforcement measures. It will be important to clarify in particular the ways in which such activities contribute to development and how human rights standards will be observed though such assistance. In addition, to ensure that ODA does not result in human rights abuses, it is critical that the term \u2018non-lethal equipment\u2019 is defined. The term may be interpreted in different ways, and some \u2018non-lethal\u2019 equipment can result in physical harm, such as the use of tear gas and crowd control equipment, undermining the very development focus of ODA.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is difficult to predict what exact impact these new aid rules will have on aid allocation and the targeting of resources to the most vulnerable people. We will know more when spending decisions are made over the coming months and years once these rules come into force. It is important that donor aid allocation and its impact on poverty reduction and development is monitored closely by parliaments, civil society and concerned governments, with any areas of concern being immediately raised and addressed by the OECD DAC.</p>\n</div><div class=\"row--cards\" ng-if=\"post.notes\">\n<div class=\"col-md-12 card m-b--2\">\n<div class=\"card__content bg--light\">\n<h3 class=\"h3\">Notes</h3>\n<div> <p>[1] Categories for conflict prevention and resolution, peace and security (purpose code 152) include security sector management and reform; civilian peacebuilding, conflict prevention and resolution; participation in international peacekeeping operations; reintegration; and SALW control.</p>\n<p>[2] For more on commitments made at the Busan High Level Forum on Development Effectiveness, see the IATI Annual Report 2015 <a href=\"http://www.aidtransparency.net/annualreport2015/downloads/IATI_Annual_Report_2015.pdf\">http://www.aidtransparency.net/annualreport2015/downloads/IATI_Annual_Report_2015.pdf</a></p>\n<p>[3] OECD DAC (February 19 2016), High Level Meeting Communiqu\u00e9.

How are national and international information systems going to manage the transition from monitoring the MDGs to monitoring the SDGs?</p>\n<p>These are but a few of the early challenges that will need to be resolved before the SDG framework can be properly implemented and monitored on a global scale. Whilst the solutions are complex and convoluted by their very nature, harnessing the potential of the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.undatarevolution.org/\" target=\"_blank\">data revolution for sustainable development</a>\u00a0that was called for by the UN Secretary General in August 2014 will go some way in meeting these challenges.</p>\n<p>A key principle behind the data revolution for sustainable development is that data has immense potential to help drive poverty eradication and sustainable development. More and better quality data needs to be collected and it needs to be as granular as possible to help ensure that no one is left behind. Critically, the data that is generated needs to be easily\u00a0<em><u>accessible</u>\u00a0</em>and\u00a0<em><u>useable</u></em>\u00a0by decision-makers, civil society groups, the private sector and citizens.</p>\n<p>One specific area that needs attention is the fostering of greater comparability and interoperability between the standards to which development-related data is currently published. At the moment, much of the data that exists remains siloed \u2013 stored in a format that cannot be easily compared to other similar data. This situation results in decision-makers only ever having snapshots of particular issues but not the full picture.</p>\n<p>The challenge of incompatibility between data standards has been recognised at the highest levels of the international development community. The Third International Conference on Financing for Development\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.un.org/esa/ffd/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/AAAA_Outcome.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">outcome document</a>\u00a0(the Addis Ababa Action Agenda) recognised the need and value of joining-up data standards at paragraph 128 for instance:</p>\n<p>\u201cData access alone, however, is not enough to fully realise the potential that data can offer to both achieving, monitoring and reviewing sustainable development goals [SDGs]. We should endeavour to ensure broad access to the tools necessary to turn data into useful, actionable information. We will support efforts to make data standards interoperable, allowing data from different sources to be more easily compared and used. [\u2026]\u201d.</p>\n<p>Similarly, Principle 4 of the recently launched\u00a0<a href=\"http://opendatacharter.net/\" target=\"_blank\">international Open Data Charter</a>\u00a0(ODC) recognises that, \u201cin order to be most effective and useful, data should be easy to compare within and between sectors, across geographic locations, and over time\u201d and that \u201cdata should be presented in structured and standardised formats to support interoperability, traceability and effective reuse.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enabling interoperability between the international data standards produced and used by development-related institutions including the UN system, the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, amongst others is at the heart of the Joined-up Data Standards (JUDS) project. Joining up data standards is not about developing one new singular standard to replace existing ones but rather about maximising the value of existing standards by enabling them to talk to each other, including in machine-readable format.</p>\n<p>In the coming months, we look forward to sharing the progress of our work with data standard setters, data producers and users, from all stakeholder groups, and starting a\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.aidtransparency.net/news/joining-up-data-standards-post-ogp15-a-need-for-joined-up-conversations\" target=\"_blank\">broader conversation</a>\u00a0on how we can jointly produce better information for decision-making and accountability purposes.

The inclusion of the \u2018neighbouring \u2018high fragility\u2019 states\u2019 category marks DFID\u2019s strategic focus beyond fragile states to include countries at risk of the effects of spill-over from fragility in neighbouring states \u2013 including Algeria, Armenia, Turkey and Thailand.</p>\n<h4><strong>Table 1: DFID\u2019s new list of fragile states and regions</strong></h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Table-1_Does-DFID\u2019s-new-fragile-states-list-point-towards-a-shift-in-funding-allocation.png\"><img alt=\"Table 1_Does DFID\u2019s new fragile states list point towards a shift in funding allocation\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-10241 size-full\" height=\"999\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Table-1_Does-DFID\u2019s-new-fragile-states-list-point-towards-a-shift-in-funding-allocation.png\" width=\"761\"/></a></p>\n<p>Notes: Countries in red did not receive any country-allocable bilateral aid from DFID in 2014.</p>\n<p>The development of this new fragile states list poses two key questions regarding the future allocation of DFID\u2019s aid:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Will the proportion of DFID\u2019s funding that is allocated to fragile states and regions change?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Analysis of DFID\u2019s bilateral funding in 2014 (as the year that data is most recently available) reveals that little is likely to change with regards to aggregate bilateral spending in fragile states and regions. In 2014, <strong>54%</strong> of DFID\u2019s bilateral funding was spent in these 64 countries and three regions, exceeding the 50% target.\u00a0This brings into question the ambition of the target and whether it is stretching enough, and whether it should be extended to cover all official development assistance (ODA) spent by all UK government departments.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Does this list point towards a notable shift in the way that DFID will allocate resources between countries in the future?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>To answer this question we really need to understand what proportion of DFID\u2019s spending is already being allocated to the countries featuring on this new fragile states list. It is difficult to ascertain the proportion of DFID\u2019s funding to multilateral agencies that ends up being channelled to these fragile contexts in current financial reporting systems. However, assessing the current allocation of DFID\u2019s bilateral funding and contrasting this against their new fragile states list will give us an idea of how country prioritisation for funding may be reshuffled in line with the implementation of the new UK Aid Strategy.</p>\n<p>In 2014, 23 of the countries on the list \u2013 including Chad and the Islamic Republic of Iran in the \u2018high fragility\u2019 category (see countries highlighted in red in Table 1) \u2013 did not receive any funding from DFID. In addition, countries in the \u2018neighbouring \u2018high fragility\u2019 states\u2019 category collectively only received 7.9% of DFID\u2019s country-allocable aid in 2014. This raises an important question as to whether these countries will be prioritised for funding to a greater extent than they have been to date, and whether other countries will lose out as a result.</p>\n<p>In particular it is not clear whether top recipient countries for funding in 2014 that do not appear in the \u2018high fragility\u2019 category will continue to be prioritised to the extent that they have been. For example, Figure 1 illustrates that Ethiopia received the highest volumes of DFID bilateral funding in 2014 (US$525 million) and is in the \u2018moderate fragility\u2019 category in DFID\u2019s new fragile states list. Similarly, Sierra Leone falls within the \u2018low fragility\u2019 category yet received the third largest volume of DFID bilateral funding in 2014 (US$387 million). There is also a question around whether countries that are not on the new list yet received a significant proportion of funding in 2014 (e.g. India, as the sixth largest recipient country in 2014) will continue to be prioritised to the same level.</p>\n<h4><strong>Figure 1: Only 40% of DFID\u2019s top 10 recipient countries in 2014 are in the \u2018high fragility\u2019 category in the DFID\u2019s new fragile states list</strong></h4>\n<h5><strong>Top recipients of DFID bilateral funding in 2014, and current country categorisation within DFID\u2019s new fragile states list</strong></h5>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Figure-1_Does-DFID\u2019s-new-fragile-states-list-point-towards-a-shift-in-funding-allocation.png\"><img alt=\"Figure 1_Does DFID\u2019s new fragile states list point towards a shift in funding allocation\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-10239 size-full\" height=\"840\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Figure-1_Does-DFID\u2019s-new-fragile-states-list-point-towards-a-shift-in-funding-allocation.png\" width=\"590\"/></a></p>\n<p>Source: OECD DAC Creditor Reporting System (CRS)</p>\n<p>As DFID moves towards the implementation of the new UK Aid Strategy, it is important that these questions are answered and that there is greater clarity on what the new fragile states list means for the future allocation of resources between countries and regions. In particular, there is a need for clearer guidance on how DFID will carve up the allocation of bilateral resources between the countries appearing in the four different categories, and whether certain categories (i.e. \u2018high fragility\u2019 counties) will receive a greater proportion than others.</p>\n<p>Reference is made by DFID to the various fragile states indices that have been drawn upon in the development of this list[2], including those produced by the UN and the World Bank.

Natural sciences have a special place in my heart so it is fitting that my first blog post marries the two fields.</p>\n<p>My first task involved \u2018sectors\u2019 \u2013 functional classifications. There are loads of standards with loads of acronyms \u2013 CRS, COFOG, ISIC, NTEE to name but a few \u2013 all describing the same things in different ways. I needed to cross-map these standards to see what joins up, and what doesn\u2019t. I started by studying the history of the international organisations responsible for these standards, discovering the origins of the classifications, how they were created and how prevalent these given classifications are now. Why, for instance do the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC) sector codes bear no relationship to the UN-maintained Classification of the Functions of Government (COFOG) standard, also developed by the OECD?</p>\n<p>Having started to track the \u2018how\u2019 and the \u2018who\u2019, I am now eager to explore the \u2018so what?\u2019 factor: can joining up data standards help add a useful perspective to our understanding of the real world? With this in mind, I looked in detail at malaria in Uganda.</p>\n<p>Malaria is endemic in 95% of Uganda and the climate promotes year-round transmission with little variability. The economic burden of the disease is heavy: it has been reported to consume up to 40% of African states\u2019 health budgets, cause up to a 1.3% reduction in growth and losses of up to US$12 billion (<a href=\"http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/Pdacn515.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">USAID 2009</a>). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), malaria significantly limits the economic and social development desperately needed to increase gross domestic product (GDP) rates.</p>\n<p>The new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) include a target to, by 2030, \u201cend the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases and combat hepatitis, water-borne diseases and other communicable diseases\u201d. Given the figures from USAID and the WHO above, achieving this goal is clearly going to be a challenge.</p>\n<p>In my research, I came across a recently published paper by\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/health360/posts/2015/10/16-long-term-economic-effects-of-malaria-eradication-in-southwestern-uganda-barofsky-anekwe-chase\" target=\"_blank\">Barofsky et al, 2015</a>\u00a0that looks at the long-term impact of malaria eradication in south western Uganda and the positive effects it has on educational attainment and economic performance (when compared with the rest of Uganda). Barofsky argues that these benefits allow planners to reduce the imputed costs of eradication programmes<strong><em>,</em></strong><em>\u00a0</em>but it is critical that international and domestic resources are coordinated to maximise both impact and cost benefit.</p>\n<p>This raises the interesting question for me, as a data scientist working on interoperability, of whether data on international aid flows and data on local-level health spending can be \u2018joined up\u2019 and compared.</p>\n<p>The OECD DAC Creditor Reporting System (CRS) enables donor countries to account for their aid spending. It is divided into 26 sectors and 151 sub-sectors, which reflect donor countries\u2019 priorities. The success of any intervention relies on the sustainability of the help as well as new solutions to old problems. CRS offers a sub-sector \u2018malaria control\u2019 under the umbrella of basic health, which entails prevention and control of malaria.</p>\n<p>COFOG coding on the other hand deals with government spending data by the purpose for which the funds are used. The CRS sector \u2018malaria\u2019 does not have a counterpart in COFOG, although elements entailed can be broadly assigned to COFOG sub-sectors within the sector \u2018health\u2019 such as: \u2018hospital services\u2019, \u2018medical products, appliances and equipment\u2019, \u2018outpatient services\u2019, \u2018public health services\u2019 or \u2018research and development in health\u2019. Having a sector related to malaria in COFOG would have made it possible to assess whether funding levels could sustain the cost of treating malaria patients and ensure sufficient amounts of medication and preventative materials, such as mosquito nets, are available.</p>\n<p>Conversely, if general OECD DAC sub-sector \u2018malaria control\u2019 could be broken down to the COFOG sub-sectors as listed above, a more detailed view of neglected areas could be discovered. Joining up data standards such as these can give us another layer of holistic understanding of the fate of international funds and help aid funds reach those most in need.

Starting in\u00a0<a href=\"http://opengovdata.org/\" target=\"_blank\">California in 2007</a>\u00a0a number of attempts have been made to enshrine the principles of open data. I think it is fair comment that most of these charters have been drafted by and for constituencies in North America and Europe and have focused primarily on the relationship between western liberal governments and economies and the technically literate sections of their citizenry. Until now.</p>\n<p>The international Open Data Charter launched in New York last month is the first globally inclusive and comprehensive manifesto of its type. It recognizes the north-south digital divide. It recognizes the challenges and needs facing developing countries. It embraces the data revolution for sustainable development data. As Jose Alonso from the Web Foundation has argued, it provides a canonical open data standard that can be embedded, adopted, and implemented by other related initiatives without duplication or fragmentation.</p>\n<p>Of equal importance is the inclusion of the principle of \u201cComparability and Interoperability\u201d \u2013 \u00a0the first time that a charter like this has moved beyond transparency to properly consider the whole point of open data: usage. Most datasets are pretty meaningless on their own. It is only when they are combined and contextualized do they generally make sense. Joined-up data creates the information we need.</p>\n<p>You can only join up datasets if they are\u00a0<em>comparable\u00a0</em>and \u201cspeak the same language\u201d. The Charter recognizes \u201cthat in order to be most effective and useful, data should be easy to compare within and between sectors, across geographic locations, and over time\u201d.</p>\n<p>And if you wish machines to do the joining up for you, the systems, formats, and definitions used by each dataset need to be\u00a0<em>interoperable</em>: \u201cdata should be presented in structured and standardized formats to support interoperability, traceability, and effective reuse\u201d.</p>\n<p>Most of the useful data that we need today \u2013 even that which is already open \u2013 resides in a massive Tower of Babel. Global institutions \u2013 the UN, OECD, World Bank, and IMF among them \u2013 maintain countless incompatible and competing standards covering financial, administrative, geographic, and socio-economic data. So do national governments. Most open data portals are silos in which thousands of datasets sit in isolation from each other, each speaking their own distinct language or dialect. Continuing this language metaphor, there are two solutions to the problem: either agree to speak the same language or get an interpreter.</p>\n<p>Principle four of the Charter first calls for \u201cincreased interoperability between existing international standards\u201d \u2013 making sure we can translate accurately between standards. It then demands that we \u201csupport the creation of common, global data standards where they do not already exist and ensure that any new data standards we create are, to the greatest extent possible, interoperable with existing standards\u201d \u2013 in other words: standards that speak the same language.</p>\n<p>The importance of the Charter is that it provides us with a platform from which to launch a two-pronged attack on data silos.</p>\n<p>We need to engage with all global and regional standard-setting institutions</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to persuade them of the importance of joined-up standards;</li>\n<li>to get them to cooperate with each other on resolving incompatibilities; and</li>\n<li>to get them to agree that all future standards will be properly joined-up.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And we need to stimulate the market to build more translation tools that will enable us to generate more usable and accessible information from existing data.</p>\n<p><em>This blog was written as a part of the <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/projects/joined-data-standards/\">Joined-up Data Standards project</a>, a joint initiative between Development Initiatives and <a href=\"http://www.publishwhatyoufund.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Publish What You Fund</a>.</em></p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Will a 'grand bargain' solve the humanitarian fund...", "author": [], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "22 Jan 2016", "description": "This article was originally written for the Guardian Development Professionals Network as an opinion-piece looking at the High Level Panel on Humanitarian", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/will-a-grand-bargain-solve-the-humanitarian-funding-crisis/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p><em>This article was originally written for the Guardian Development Professionals Network as an opinion-piece looking at the High Level Panel on Humanitarian Financing Report. </em></p>\n<p>The aptly titled report\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.whsummit.org/whs_finance/hlphumanitarianfinancing\">Too important to fail</a>\u00a0from the High Level Panel on Humanitarian Financing was launched in Dubai yesterday. Does it offer viable solutions to the widening gap between humanitarian needs and available resources? Is the \u2018grand bargain\u2019 it offers enough to transform a struggling aid system?</p>\n<p>All eyes are on humanitarian financing in 2016. The\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.worldhumanitariansummit.org/\">World Humanitarian Summit</a> in May is fast approaching and the launch of the report comes against a backdrop of the displacement of millions of people in Syria, Yemen, South Sudan, Iraq and other disaster and conflict-affected countries. Their suffering reminds us of the need to get this right fast.</p>\n<p>The report contains many good ideas; the strongest and most exciting are those that speak to audiences beyond the usual humanitarian crowd. For example, giving middle-income countries access to grants and low-income loans to finance large-scale refugee hosting, working with the insurance industry to adapt its risk-financing strategies to humanitarian situations, and tapping into the billions of dollars generated each year through Islamic social finance.</p>\n<p>Few of the initiatives suggested are new \u2013 nor does the panel claim they are. Many have been discussed at length by other groups, and already piloted and reviewed in some cases. But seen together for the first time, and presented as compellingly as they are in the report, they have the potential to expand the responsibility to act beyond the narrow confines of the humanitarian community. The recommendations use finance as a driving force to enrich the aid ecosystem and push for institutional changes to bridge the humanitarian and development divide. This challenge is more pertinent than ever today given the increasingly protracted nature of crises around the world.</p>\n<h4><strong>How radical is the \u2018grand bargain\u2019?</strong></h4>\n<p>The \u2018grand bargain\u2019 comes at the end of the report and may leave many readers asking whether the deal is radical enough. It proposes that the major donors and largest humanitarian organisations commit to make their spending more flexible, efficient, transparent and effective. The bargain is aimed in particular at the five largest government donors of humanitarian assistance, those that supplied\u00a0<a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Chapter-3.pdf\">over 60% of the international humanitarian resources in 2014</a>; and the six UN agencies that\u00a0<a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Chapter-5.pdf\">spent nearly half of it</a>.</p>\n<p>The logic is that if the giants can get it right, other donors and aid organisations will follow. But starting here does risk establishing the terms of the bargain in favour of these powerful few and thereby entrenching the concentration of funds even further, rather than encouraging a more diverse and equitable distribution of resources as recommended elsewhere in the report.</p>\n<p>There is also the question of those without a seat at the bargaining table. The Gulf states and other emerging donors are clearly a central part of the financing solution. The choice of Dubai for the report launch yesterday reminds us of how important they are. The report is unclear however whether Gulf states are invited to negotiate the terms of the bargain, or to be bound by it. The same goes for international, national and local NGOs \u2013 vital links in the chain between UN agencies and crisis-affected populations \u2013 who are already asking what their role is in the bargaining process.</p>\n<p>The specific components of the bargain also appear to fall short of the panel\u2019s ambition to ensure that resources are found to meet the needs of those most likely to be left behind. We don\u2019t just need more joint assessments between a few big humanitarian agencies, we need a radical rethink of what we know about what makes people vulnerable to crisis in the first place and how to match their needs with the right resources. On transparency, the grand bargain may do something to improve reporting of international humanitarian assistance by a few, but we should aim for more. A bigger vision is required, in which all resources, beyond just international humanitarian resources can be counted.</p>\n<p>Turning the grand bargain into a big deal will clearly be a challenge. Vested interests, competition for scarce resources, and the humanitarian-development divide are as old as aid itself. What\u2019s different now, perhaps, is the window of opportunity that the World Humanitarian Summit has created. Responsibility for taking the panel\u2019s recommendations forward now passes from the hands of technical experts to those of the political and financial decision-makers who will be represented en masse in Istanbul in May. This combined with the scale of the problem, and the reputation and clout of the panel members themselves as they go out and canvass support, may be the tipping point that we\u2019ve all been waiting for.</p>\n<p>The grand bargain will be a central topic of numerous global-level humanitarian meetings in the coming months. Even more interesting will be to see whether the panel\u2019s recommendations get picked up outside of the humanitarian calendar. Will other actors agree that this is too important to ignore, and that they too have a stake in addressing the humanitarian financing gap? If the answer is yes, then the grand bargain may turn out to be a big deal after all.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jan/18/will-a-grand-bargain-solve-the-humanitarian-funding-crisis\">This article was originally published on Monday 18<sup>th</sup> January 2016 the Guardian Development Professionals Network</a></p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "The challenges facing national institutions in lea...", "author": ["Richard Watts"], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "13 Jan 2016", "description": "In July of last year there was universal agreement under the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on the need for national institutions to be at the heart of, and hav", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/challenges-facing-national-institutions-in-leading-their-poverty-eradication-agendas/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>In July of last year there was <a href=\"http://www.un.org/esa/ffd/ffd3/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/07/Addis-Ababa-Action-Agenda-Draft-Outcome-Document-7-July-2015.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">universal agreement under the Addis Ababa Action Agenda</a> on the need for national institutions to be at the heart of, and have ownership over, their own development agendas to drive sustainable poverty alleviation efforts. In addition to this, it was agreed that a full mix of financing including aid, international and domestic commercial resources, and public domestic resources is required to achieve it.</p>\n<p>Of course, the mix of resources needed to promote growth and end poverty will be different in different country contexts. But for national institutions to have effective ownership of development policy, domestic public resources must provide a solid financing core that resources such as official development assistance (ODA) and commercial finance are built around.</p>\n<p>This presents a problem for the poorest countries where, in the majority of cases, that core is not currently as large or as well used as it could be. A central challenge is therefore how countries can make more effective use of domestic public resources in sustainable and progressive ways to provide an adequate financing core for achieving nationally led pro-poor development outcomes.</p>\n<h3><strong>Domestic public revenue is very low in the poorest countries, and current projections predict low growth</strong></h3>\n<p>As explained in our <em><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/investments-to-end-poverty-2015\" target=\"_blank\">Investments to End Poverty 2015</a></em> report, governments in many developing countries raise too little revenue to implement the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at the national level. As shown below, the countries with the greatest challenge in ending poverty have the lowest resources. Many sub-Saharan African countries in particular have a <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/data?chart-state=%7B%22id%22:%22world-map%22,%22config%22:%7B%22year%22:2011,%22theme%22:%22poorest20pct%22,%22indicator%22:%22depth-of-extreme-poverty%22,%22setMostRecent%22:true%7D%7D\" target=\"_blank\">high depth of poverty</a> and <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/data?chart-state=%7B%22id%22:%22world-map%22,%22config%22:%7B%22year%22:2012,%22theme%22:%22dpf%22,%22indicator%22:%22govtspend-pc%22,%22setMostRecent%22:false%7D%7D\" target=\"_blank\">low government resources</a>. Revenue in countries in this region is less than PPP$500 (adjusted for purchasing power parity) per person per year, with many even less than PPP$250 per person per year. To give an idea of just how low this is, other developing countries such as Namibia, Gabon and Bolivia raises over PPP$2000 per person per year. And developed countries such as the US and UK raise over PPP$15,000. For an in-depth look at the numbers,<a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/data?chart-state=%7B%22id%22:%22world-map%22,%22config%22:%7B%22year%22:2014,%22theme%22:%22dpf%22,%22indicator%22:%22non-grant-revenue-PPP-capita%22,%22setMostRecent%22:false%7D%7D\" target=\"_blank\"> our Development Data Hub gives the global picture on domestic resource expenditure.</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Figure-3.1.png\"><img alt=\"Figure 3.1\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-10101 size-full\" height=\"623\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Figure-3.1.png\" width=\"839\"/></a></p>\n<p>In addition<strong>, </strong>based on current projections (see graph below), countries where poverty is deepest have the lowest predicted growth. Without a significant shift in domestic resource mobilisation, it is likely that real-term domestic revenues will remain stagnant in the poorest countries.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Figure-3.3.png\"><img alt=\"Figure 3.3\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-10102 size-full\" height=\"517\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Figure-3.3.png\" width=\"1056\"/></a></p>\n<h3><strong>Continued reliance on external finance in key sectors is linked to ending poverty</strong></h3>\n<p>During the last 15 years commitments have been established to ensure a minimum domestic spend on key sectors such as agriculture, water and sanitation, and education. This has led to increases as a percentage of spending to certain sectors, for example health spending in sub-Saharan Africa saw an increase from 7.4% in 2000 to 8.3% in 2013 and education from 14.1% to 17.3% in a similar period. However, while we may see an increase in the proportion of spend in key sectors, absolute spend is still very low and the poorest countries continue to struggle to allocate sufficient resources to key sectors.</p>\n<p>While we see governments in the poorest countries becoming less reliant on concessional finance for their own financing bundle, dependence remains very high in key sectors linked to poverty reduction. Rwanda and Burundi, among others, show a dominance of donor resources in health and agricultural sectors.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ITEP-Fig-7.png\"><img alt=\"ITEP Fig 7\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-10103 size-full\" height=\"885\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1063px) 100vw, 1063px\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ITEP-Fig-7.png\" srcset=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ITEP-Fig-7.png 1063w, http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ITEP-Fig-7-120x100.png 120w\" width=\"1063\"/></a></p>\n<p>Explore further in our Development Data Hub: <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/country/senegal?chart-state=%7B%22id%22:%22expenditure%22,%22config%22:%7B%22year%22:2013,%22budgetType%22:%22actual%22,%22activeNodes%22:%7B%22total-expenditure%22:%22total-expenditure%22,%22total-expenditure-by-sector%22:%22health%2\" target=\"_blank\">health spending in Senegal</a> and <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/country/uganda?chart-state=%7B%22id%22:%22expenditure%22,%22config%22:%7B%22year%22:2014,%22budgetType%22:%22actual%22,%22activeNodes%22:%7B%22total-expenditure%22:%22total-expenditure%22,%22total-expenditure-by-sector%22:%22education\" target=\"_blank\">education spending in Uganda</a>.</p>\n<p>There are a number of potential issues with governments having such a reliance on funding for key sectors from external concessional finance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Funding can be conditional or for a specific project and may not necessary be aligned with government systems or plans; this can create a lack of tangible ownership and means that governments don\u2019t have full control over the scale or nature of investments in key sectors</li>\n<li>The payment of promised allocations can be unpredictable (either delayed or potentially not delivered)</li>\n<li>The opportunity for significant scale up of concessional finance to these key sectors is limited as a result of the current global economic climate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given the lack of potential return on investments in some key sectors, non-concessional finance is not a viable option. Therefore, domestic public resources is the best avenue for increasing funding to provide a financing core that is both sustainable and predicable. This solid core should significantly increase the potential to shape other financing to meet national development plans.</p>\n<h3><strong>But there is potential for greater domestic resource mobilisation</strong></h3>\n<p>While low revenue may put financial constraints on providing services and making investments, such a low baseline leaves significant potential for improvement. Based on many developing countries mobilising resources equivalent to 20% of GDP as a minimum, many of the poorest countries (that raise less than 15%) have the potential to realise a substantial rise through strategies to strengthen national institutions and improve tax collection systems.[1]</p>\n<p>Donors clearly have a role to play in this; domestic resource mobilisation through ODA is gaining more attention and recent <a href=\"http://www.taxcompact.net/documents/Addis-Tax-Initiative_Declaration.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">commitments to doubling technical assistance in this area</a> is in recognition of countries making better plans at the national level for setting and achieving SDG targets.

Indeed, it notes that figures for many of the appeals are preliminary estimates and those for Sudan are yet to come. During 2015 requirements rose by nearly a fifth (approximately 21% or US$3.5 billion), largely driven by the addition of the Sahel appeals as well as the Nepal flash appeal and increased requirements for Yemen. And 2015 saw a relatively modest rise compared with the roughly 40% and 50% increases in the course of the previous two years respectively.</p>\n<h4>Figure 1: UN coordinated appeals 2006-2016: requirements at launch and revised requirements by end of year</h4>\n<h3><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/UN-coordinated-appeals-2016-Figure-1.jpg\"><img alt=\"UN-coordinated appeals 2016 Figure 1\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7094\" height=\"353\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/UN-coordinated-appeals-2016-Figure-1-714x353.jpg\" width=\"714\"/></a></h3>\n<p>Source: Development Initiatives based on UN OCHA\u2019s Global Humanitarian Overview, UN OCHA FTS and media reports</p>\n<p>Notes: Figures are based on data available on 30 November 2015 and include preliminary estimates of some countries that are subject to change.

While a humanitarian requirements document (HRD) for Ethiopia was also launched in 2015, this is the first time it has been included in the global appeal, an indication of the severity of the current situation [2]. The 2016 requirement for Ethiopia is triple that of the mid-2015 HRD making it the fourth largest appeal for the year ahead.</p>\n<p>The Syria crisis appeals continue to dominate the appeals requirements. Combined, the US$3.2 billion appeal for requirements inside Syria and the US$4.8 billion requirement for the refugees in neighbouring countries (Refugee Response and Resilience Plan \u2013 3RP) make up 40% of global total requirements, a volume and proportion that has been steadily on the rise.

This presents a key moment to look at adaptation-related official development assistance (ODA) \u2013 aid for building resilience to the impacts of climate change \u2013 and assess its ability to target the most vulnerable people. Current data shows that much needs to be done to ensure it is protecting those who are most at risk.</p>\n<p>ODA is the <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/improvingoda2015\" target=\"_blank\">primary international public resource that can be explicitly dedicated to reducing poverty</a>. Thus among the multiple climate finance mechanisms that currently exist, climate-related ODA has a particular responsibility to recognise the links between poverty and climate change vulnerability and support interventions that assist the poorest people to mitigate against or adapt to the effects of climate change.</p>\n<p>Climate-related ODA, particularly adaptation ODA, has an especially important role to play in the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) era given <a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Chapter-1-Ending-extreme-poverty-by-2030.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">extreme poverty is increasingly concentrated in complex and challenging contexts</a> where conflict, instability and environmental vulnerability overlap. Adaptation ODA can help ensure the sustainability of SDG target outcomes through supporting interventions that seek to end poverty by strengthening the resilience of the poorest people against shocks and stresses that threaten efforts to end poverty.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Chapter-4-International-official-finance.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Our analysis</a> of <a href=\"https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=CRS1\" target=\"_blank\">data from the OECD</a> shows that total climate-related ODA investments have been increasing over the last decade but contributions from bilateral donors do not adequately target countries where vulnerability to climate change and poverty is greatest. In 2013 for example, just 9% of country-allocable[1]\u00a0adaptation ODA targeted countries with the highest levels of vulnerability to climate change.</p>\n<p>Our chart looks at the volume of adaptation ODA commitments to developing countries against their vulnerability and poverty depth levels and shows how resources are not allocated to where need is greatest. Liberia, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo for example received just 2% of total adaptation ODA in 2013 despite being in the highest ranges of both poverty depth and vulnerability. Conversely, over a quarter (27%) of adaptation ODA targeted countries with medium levels of vulnerability and relatively low levels of poverty (1%\u20135%). Viet Nam received the single greatest amount, equal to 13% of total adaptation ODA, yet is statistically less vulnerable than most countries and has less severe poverty.</p>\n<p>Our chart also reveals that many of the countries among the highest ranges of vulnerability and poverty depth are also countries facing conflict and political fragility. Such countries in particular receive relatively small amounts of climate-related ODA despite their vulnerability.</p>\n<p>Although this is a top-line analysis, it is clear that support currently provided to developing countries for climate change adaptation falls short of needs and could be targeted more effectively. Further analysis is of course needed, and is limited by a <a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Chapter-5-Data-for-decision-making.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">lack of comprehensive and quality data on poverty and vulnerability</a>.

Better data relates to better lives through better policies, programmes, and better allocation, accountability and coordination of resources.</p>\n<p>With poor data, decision makers are more likely to make less effective and efficient decisions on the allocation of resources and on policies aiming to improve lives especially of the poor. For example without quality data, we cannot tell the exact number of poor people, where they live, when they get out and back into poverty, how targeted policies are changing their lives, learn the best lessons and replicate them in ending poverty.</p>\n<p>Data is needed to monitor and measure progress towards achieving sub-national, national, regional and global targets set by our leaders \u2013 such as district work plans, national development plans, Africa\u2019s <a href=\"http://agenda2063.au.int/\">Agenda 2063</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/\">Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</a>.</p>\n<h3>The current state of national statistical systems is still lacking in Africa</h3>\n<p>The demand for quality disaggregated data for sub-national decision-making and service delivery has outstripped the supply of data by the <a href=\"https://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=1726\">national statistical systems</a>. National statistical systems in Africa need reforms. Many countries are still publishing official statistics under out-dated statistical legislations of the 1960s. They are faced with weaknesses in the capacity to collect, process, manage, analyse, interpret and use statistics. There are inadequate links between statistical systems and policy processes meaning that the data are often not relevant to today\u2019s issues. Statistical production in many countries is not aligned with national planning and budget timetables, and is inadequately coordinated with multiple players. </p>\n<p>National statistical services\u2019 data collection is primarily concentrated on censuses and surveys. Until recently little attention and resource has been committed to civil registration systems and other administrative data. Many countries in sub-Saharan Africa still have low quality data. Official statistics are normally not timely, have coverage issues (in terms of both indicators and statistical units) and are not comparable over time or with other sources. For example in surveys, only 45% of African countries have conducted one or another form of household survey in the last 3 years. According to the World Bank, only 33% have conducted more than 2 poverty-related surveys in the past 10 years. And only 20% have conducted an agricultural survey in the past 3 years.  <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/functioning-birth-registration-systems-are-lacking-in-most-african-countries\">Just 12 of 55 African countries have comprehensive birth registration and a quarter of African countries have not done a survey since 2008 or earlier</a>.  Many such challenges lie ahead for countries to meet the data needs of their national development goals.</p>\n<p>Data needs to be improved in order to improve lives. There is need for a data revolution to sustainably improve data systems for collecting vital statistics, including birth data. Investments in civil registration systems, and infrastructure to store and share data, are needed so that we can count people and make people count. </p>\n<h3>Technology uptake is low in African national statistical systems</h3>\n<p>The traditional method of data collection that most African statistical systems use, based on paper-based survey forms, is costly, time-consuming, and prone to errors. The usage of mobile devices and the Internet is beginning to replace these methods. </p>\n<p>Technology allows statistical processes to meet requirements and expectations such as timeliness of data, accuracy, relevance, coverage, openness and accessibility, cost effectiveness and disaggregation to the lowest institutional unit. For example geospatial technology  is an efficient and effective tool for conducting censuses and surveys, because it has desirable features with regard to data collection (such as agricultural, demographic, forestry, urban and rural planning statistics), storing, processing, timeliness, coverage and dissemination.</p>\n<p>Only a few national statistical services in Africa have taken up ICT tools in a few projects. For example the <a href=\"http://www.ons.dz/\">office for national statistics in Algeria</a> used optical scanning technology for the exploitation of economic Census questionnaires and CAPI (Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing) in interviews in a number of surveys in 2011. </p>\n<p>National statistical services are often over staffed with non-professional personnel, leaving a poor mix of workers. Though they have professional statisticians on their payroll, in many cases they do not get the full complement of other specialists like statistical programmers/data scientists, software engineers, economists, and communication specialists. This staffing problem, among others such as low financing, lack of proper ICT infrastructure; keeps the level of usage and up-take of new technologies low. </p>\n<h3>Way forward</h3>\n<p>Quality official statistics could help decision makers develop informed policies that impact millions of people. Improved data sources, sound statistical methods, new technologies and strengthened statistical systems enable better decisions that eventually result in better lives for all of us.  The national statistical systems can be enhanced through developing and maintaining appropriate human and modern technology infrastructure assets to ensure better data in Africa.</p>\n<p>Arrangements for inter-institutional co-ordination, collaboration, partnerships and networking for capacity building, information and technology sharing among data producers are weak and should be strengthened as part of the statistical reforms. For example Development Initiatives\u2019 <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/data\">development data hub</a> is one of the innovations that statistical offices can partner with in terms of joining up data from the national statistical services and dissemination of official statistics.</p>\n<p>Finally, the <a href=\"http://www.uneca.org/datarevolution\">Africa Data Consensus</a> provides a framework for all countries to rally behind and move ahead in a coordinated and mutually supporting approach towards sustainable data infrastructures that can deliver usable information to all levels of administration and service delivery throughout Africa. This is the meaning of better data for better lives.</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "What does the new extreme poverty data show?", "author": [], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "27 Oct 2015", "description": "New World Bank data leaves our understanding of the distribution of extreme poverty and projections largely unchanged, but confirms past global poverty tar", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/what-does-the-new-extreme-poverty-data-show/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>New World Bank data leaves our understanding of the distribution of extreme poverty and projections largely unchanged, but confirms past global poverty targets were met and future targets remain challenging.</p>\n<p>The global benchmark measure of extreme poverty has been revised to use more up-to-date comparisons of prices internationally. These purchasing power parities (PPPs) compare the cost of the same basket of goods and services in different countries to enable comparison between them (see our <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/the-world-bank-is-changing-the-1-25-a-day-measure-of-extreme-poverty\">data blog </a>before the release). They give an exchange rate between dollars and other countries\u2019 currencies that allows people to buy the same basket.</p>\n<p>The extreme poverty line has been updated to $1.90-a-day in 2011 PPPs, having been $1.25 in 2005 PPPs for many years. The 15 national poverty lines used to set the 2005 line were updated for inflation nationally, converted into dollars using the new 2011 PPPs then averaged, resulting in $1.90.</p>\n<p>Comparing estimates on the two measures for 2011 shows relatively small changes to the overall extreme poverty level and its regional distribution.</p>\n<h4>Figure 1: People in extreme poverty by region in 2011 (millions, 2005 and 2011 PPPs)</h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/What-does-the-new-extreme-poverty-data-show-Figure-1.jpg\"><img alt=\"What does the new extreme poverty data show Figure 1\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-9718\" height=\"196\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/What-does-the-new-extreme-poverty-data-show-Figure-1.jpg\" width=\"787\"/></a></p>\n<p>The extreme poverty line seems to have been revised up while poverty levels have been revised down. But the increase is in US dollar terms. Different countries PPPs will have strengthened or weakened against the US prices.</p>\n<p>The revision attempts to maintain the extreme poverty benchmark allowing for such movements: the $1.25-a-day line in 2005 PPPs and the $1.90-a-day line in 2011 PPPs are intended to represent the same poverty level. Effectively one dollar could generally buy less in local currencies in 2011 than in 2005, or local currencies could buy more. Where a country\u2019s buying power rises relative to the US dollar, extreme poverty will fall, while extreme poverty will rise in countries where relative buying power has fallen.*</p>\n<p>Data for most developing countries for the new measure can now be explored on <a href=\"http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/index.htm\">PovcalNet</a>, the World Bank\u2019s online poverty tool.</p>\n<p>Forecasts suggest that the Millennium Development Goal target to halve global extreme poverty rates was achieved well ahead of the 2015 deadline.

The new $1.90-a-day measure seems likely to be included as the indicator for monitoring progress towards this target.</p>\n<p>Available projections suggest that the general picture is broadly similar on either measure. The 2030 goal remains challenging, yet achievable, on the $1.90-a-day measure. As our <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/investments-to-end-poverty\">Investments to End Poverty 2013</a> report showed, existing patterns of economic growth are unlikely to achieve this goal alone.

This is known as administrative data and is collected on a daily basis in the course of government\u2019s work and is routinely turned into statistics for reporting purposes. National censuses, usually conducted every ten years, are used as key points of reference. Periodic surveys are used to sense check the data and to fill in gaps \u2013\u00a0 on attitudes and behaviours, for example.</p>\n<p>Few developing countries currently have the financial, technical and human resources to maintain all the administrative data they need. Civil registration is a case in point: many countries have rudimentary systems for the issuance of birth and death certificates (if people ask for them) but few are capable of turning these paper certificates into comprehensive and meaningful statistics that can be used for the planning and allocation of resources. National statistics offices, supported by the World Bank, USAID and other donors, currently employ a range of surveys as a substitute, the most common being the \u2018household survey\u2019. These are conducted using a representative sample of households spread across large statistical regions. In Uganda, for example (which has one of Africa\u2019s best national statistical systems) about 1 in 1,000 households are surveyed in 10 regions each comprising 10 or more districts \u2013 the cornerstone of local government. District officials, responsible for service delivery at the cutting edge, can thus make little use of survey results as they need data that is disaggregated to a level below their area of responsibility.</p>\n<p>The aim of the much heralded <a href=\"http://www.undatarevolution.org/\">\u2018Data Revolution for Sustainable Development\u2019</a> is to ensure that not only is data available to meet (not just monitor) the Sustainable Development Goals, but also to ensure that sustainable data sources are established to ensure that in future \u2013 by 2030? \u2013 the digital divide between developing and developed countries is removed and the world shares common statistical methodologies. For this to happen two key requirements need to be met: firstly substantial domestic and international resources will be required to build, improve and maintain management\u00a0 information systems across government; secondly a strategy that recognises both short-term statistical needs (using existing survey-dominated methodologies) as well as a long-term, sustainable solution.</p>\n<p>The World Bank Group is actively involved in this revolution and has earmarked $100m for investment in Civil Registration and is seeking to raise a similar amount for Statistical Capacity Development. Their <a href=\"http://www.data4sdgs.org/commitments/\">commitment to the\u00a0 Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data</a> stated that \u201cthe WBG will support improvements to country systems by building on what works, ensuring country policy priorities determine where additional support is targeted by helping to maximize the value of what data is collected by making it accessible and usable.\u201d</p>\n<p>It is against this backdrop that we need to assess the <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2015/10/15/world-bank-new-end-poverty-tool-surveys-in-poorest-countries\">World Bank\u2019s announcement</a> to raise and spend $1,5 billion ($300m every three years until 2030) on household surveys. This single commitment dwarves all other investments that have been made towards building a base for sustainable data collection and usage. It sends a signal that recurrent expenditure producing short-term results to meet the needs of global goals is preferable to capital investments producing resilient country information systems that will have a life way beyond 2030. A raid of this scale into the pot of limited resources available to the data revolution is short-sighted and unsustainable.</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Humanitarian assistance to fragile states is often...", "author": [], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "06 Oct 2015", "description": "Aid provided to fragile and conflict-affected states is often volatile and unpredictable.

The Millennium Development Goals were a success, helping to halve extreme poverty globally. The new goals are pledging to end extreme poverty by 2030, and this challenge is going to be much tougher than halving it was, and here is why.</p>\n<h3><strong>1. Extreme poverty is increasingly concentrated in complex and difficult contexts</strong></h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/data?chart-state=%7B%22id%22:%22world-map%22,%22config%22:%7B%22year%22:2013,%22theme%22:%22poorest20pct%22,%22indicator%22:%22poor-people%22,%22setMostRecent%22:true%7D%7D\">number of people in extreme poverty</a> who live in complex situations is on the rise. While 20% of extremely poor people lived in fragile states in the 1990s, today that figure is now 62%. Couple this with environmental vulnerability, and a huge 96% of those living on less than $1.25 a day are in fragile or vulnerable states.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Five-reasons-why-ending-poverty-Fig-1.png\"><img alt=\"Five reasons why ending poverty Fig 1\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-9658\" height=\"820\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Five-reasons-why-ending-poverty-Fig-1.png\" width=\"1579\"/></a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This means the causes of extreme poverty are harder to tackle and the need to safeguard progress is greater. It is a further challenge for sustainability since climate change and conflict are both factors that can push people rapidly into poverty and keep them there for a long time \u2013 for example, <a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Chapter-4.pdf\">the largest recipients of global humanitarian assistance are countries in protracted or recurrent crisis</a>.</p>\n<h3><strong>2. Global trends have masked big national differences\u2026.</strong></h3>\n<p>The Millennium Development Goals saw poverty halved \u2013 a huge achievement. We must however be conscious of the fact that<a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Chapter-1-Ending-extreme-poverty-by-2030.pdf\"> in 30 countries extreme poverty actually went up</a> during this time. The most rapid increase in extreme poverty can be seen in 18 sub-Saharan African countries.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Five-reasons-why-ending-poverty-Fig-2.png\"><img alt=\"Five reasons why ending poverty Fig 2\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-9662\" height=\"552\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Five-reasons-why-ending-poverty-Fig-2.png\" width=\"1039\"/></a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Chapter-1-Ending-extreme-poverty-by-2030.pdf\">To end poverty by 2030, sub-Saharan Africa would need to reduce poverty at a pace faster than South Asia has achieved over the last 15 years.</a></p>\n<h3>3. \u2026and national trends have masked sub-national differences</h3>\n<p>Between 2005 and 2012 <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/country/india\">India</a> saw poverty reduce by 10% a year in some states, but in 8 smaller states <a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Chapter-1-Ending-extreme-poverty-by-2030.pdf\">available data shows that poverty increased</a>. With the new <a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/?menu=1300\">Sustainable Development Goals promising to leave no one behind</a>, we must see a shift beyond national averages to sub-national approaches to poverty reduction.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Five-reasons-why-ending-poverty-Fig-3.png\"><img alt=\"Five reasons why ending poverty Fig 3\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-9675\" height=\"550\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Five-reasons-why-ending-poverty-Fig-3.png\" width=\"920\"/></a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This requires a change in how decisions are made about targeting resources and much more detailed and transparent <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/data\">data on people in poverty</a> and how they are progressing.</p>\n<h3><strong>4. We also need to change behaviour in how aid is allocated to make it much more about the poorest people</strong></h3>\n<p>It is widely acknowledged that aid (or \u2018official development assistance\u2019 or \u2018ODA\u2019 as it is more technically known) will play an important role in achieving global goals to end poverty; but, despite <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/improvingoda2015\">its unique poverty-tackling power</a> as an international resource, it is often not spent directly on the poorest people. The mandate for ODA is <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/ecosoc/newfunct/pdf15/un_improving_oda_allocation_for_post-2015_world_policy_briefing.pdf\">\u2018promotion of economic development and welfare\u2019</a>, which leaves a lot of room for it to be spent far wider than direct poverty reduction, and indeed <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/data?chart-state=%7B%22id%22:%22world-map%22,%22config%22:%7B%22year%22:2013,%22theme%22:%22official%22,%22indicator%22:%22oda-per-poor-person%22,%22setMostRecent%22:true%7D%7D\">this is the case</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Five-reasons-why-ending-poverty-Fig-4.png\"><img alt=\"Five reasons why ending poverty Fig 4\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-9673\" height=\"1001\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1201px) 100vw, 1201px\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Five-reasons-why-ending-poverty-Fig-4.png\" srcset=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Five-reasons-why-ending-poverty-Fig-4.png 1201w, http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Five-reasons-why-ending-poverty-Fig-4-120x100.png 120w\" width=\"1201\"/></a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The wide variety of forms that aid can take allows it to be flexible and adaptable, unlike commercial resources that are bound by the need to seek profit and flow mostly to more economically developed countries. And while institutions in developing countries must take a lead in post-2015 implementation, <a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Chapter-3-Domestic-public-resources.pdf\">the poorest countries simply don\u2019t have the money to achieve poverty eradication by 2030</a>. Making aid a lot more focussed on poverty reduction will be an important factor in ending poverty.</p>\n<h3><strong>5. And finally, we need much better data to be able to measure our progress and get poverty to zero</strong></h3>\n<p>There is need for a\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.undatarevolution.org/catalog/\">data revolution</a>\u00a0to sustainably improve data systems for collecting vital statistics so we can count people and make people count. Systems to produce even basic information on how many people there are do not function in many African countries. <a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Chapter-5-Data-for-decision-making.pdf\">Just 12 out of 55 African countries have comprehensive birth registration and a quarter of African countries have not done a survey since 2008 or earlier.</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Five-reasons-why-ending-poverty-Fig-5.png\"><img alt=\"Five reasons why ending poverty Fig 5\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-9664\" height=\"481\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Five-reasons-why-ending-poverty-Fig-5.png\" width=\"784\"/></a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Civil registration of births, for example, is vital for undertakings such as estimating population size and understanding demographic trends; it is also key for policy making and planning in areas such as provision of public services. Without accurate information on how many people there are we cannot know whether we are effectively targeting the poorest people and making sure no one is left behind.</p>\n<h3><strong>A much bigger challenge, but one we can meet</strong></h3>\n<p>We have a big challenge on our hands \u2013 much bigger than delivering the Millennium Development Goals. But being fully aware of the scale of the task is the only way we can succeed. We must be bold and ambitious in our efforts to end poverty and not give up until we leave no one behind.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "The World Bank is changing the $1.25-a-day measure...", "author": [], "format": "Data blog", "date": "02 Oct 2015", "description": "What is changing and what does it mean?

They are arrived at using hundreds of surveys, long chains of transformations and several assumptions. This inherently difficult task rests on being able to compare data on national incomes between countries.</p>\n<p>The standard approach is \u2018purchasing power parity\u2019 (PPP), which uses the cost of a common basket of goods to compare prices internationally. The <a href=\"http://siteresources.worldbank.org/ICPEXT/Resources/ICP_2011.html\">process behind this</a> is extensive and takes several years. Until now, our best understanding of extreme poverty was based on the $1.25-a-day poverty line, which used PPPs dating from 2005, but a new set of figures is now available using 2011 PPPs.</p>\n<h4><strong>What\u2019s changing and why?</strong></h4>\n<p>A \u2018<a href=\"http://www.odi.org/comment/8435-poverty-numbers\">minor earthquake</a>\u2018 was seen in 2008 when the $1.25-a-day line replaced the previous $1.08 line, which was based on 1993 prices, as it led to an additional 400 million people being estimated to be in extreme poverty in 2005 than previously thought.</p>\n<p>The benchmark is about to be adjusted again to further improve its accuracy and timeliness. The new 2011 PPPs have much wider coverage, of 199 countries compared with 146 in 2005, and improvements in data for large countries such as China and India.</p>\n<p>The poverty line is <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/09/23/planets-poor-set-to-swell-as-world-bank-revises-poverty-line.html\">expected to be set</a> at \u201caround $1.90\u201d in 2011 prices. While this might appear to be a 50% increase from the $1.25 line, that was based on 2005 prices so cannot be directly compared. This change is partly down to adjusting for price rises over the last six years and partly because <a href=\"https://blogs.worldbank.org/developmenttalk/measuring-poverty-rapidly-changing-world\">inflation for the poorest countries</a> is to be used, leading to a slightly higher line.</p>\n<h4><strong>What do the new figures mean?</strong></h4>\n<p>A change to the global extreme poverty line inevitably leads to changes in estimates of the scale and distribution of extreme poverty. <strong>Individuals\u2019 incomes will not have changed, only our understanding of how they compare globally.</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2015/05/24442564/global-poverty-goals-prices-purchasing-power-parity-matters\">Previous work</a> by World Bank researchers on an extreme poverty line of $1.92 in 2011 prices provides an insight into what this might mean, ahead of the publication of the new data.</p>\n<p>Overall, the number of extremely poor people was estimated to be 148 million higher than on the old measure, much less than in the <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2008/09/16/new-data-show-14-billion-live-less-us125-day-progress-against-poverty-remains-strong\">last revision in 2008</a>, but still represents a change in our understanding of recent poverty trends. Regionally, the East Asia &amp; Pacific region sees the largest shift, with an additional 136 million people in extreme poverty in 2011. Smaller increases are seen in some regions, no change from 416 million people in sub-Saharan Africa, and a slight reduction in numbers in the Middle East &amp; North Africa.</p>\n<h4><strong>2011 extreme poverty estimates, millions</strong></h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/World-bank-data-blog.png\"><img alt=\"World bank data blog\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9638\" height=\"296\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/World-bank-data-blog.png\" width=\"1259\"/></a></p>\n<p>Source: Jolliffe\u00a0&amp; Prydz, \u201c<a href=\"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2015/05/24442564/global-poverty-goals-prices-purchasing-power-parity-matters\">Global poverty goals and prices: how purchasing power parity matters</a>\u201d, World Bank Policy Research working paper 7256, May 2015, table 3</p>\n<p>While this sets the starting point a little higher for the goal to end poverty by 2030, it was already clear that current patterns of economic growth would not be enough to achieve that goal, with millions of people expected to remain in poverty by 2030. Crucially, projections for the number of people in extreme poverty by 2030 using the $1.92-a-day line are only marginally higher than those based on the $1.25-a-day line: 399 million compared with 389 million previously, with the vast majority of people living in sub-Saharan Africa in both cases. This affirms the case for targeted interventions to help the people furthest from the poverty line.</p>\n<h4><strong>Better data is needed for ending poverty by 2030</strong></h4>\n<p>While our global poverty snapshot gets a little clearer, persistent issues cloud our full understanding of who the poorest people are, where they live and the depth of their poverty. Measures of aggregate national progress may have been sufficient to monitor and achieve the Millennium Development Goal to halve global poverty rates, but ending poverty by 2030 means leaving no-one behind \u2013 demanding much better and disaggregated data both for understanding the challenge and assessing the impact of efforts to address it. Good data is a fundamental requirement for accurately identifying the poorest and most vulnerable people, tracking their progress and driving resource allocation.</p>\n<p>DI\u2019s <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/investments-to-end-poverty-2015\"><em>Investments to End Poverty</em></a> report explores data issues in detail, but urgent improvements at national and international levels are needed if the world is to reach the ambitious, but achievable, goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030. These include:</p>\n<p><strong>More regular and more transparent global poverty data updates:</strong> While the World Bank has started to publish annual updates to its comprehensive global poverty estimates, these remain out-of-date: the most recent comprehensive country-level information is for 2011. More regular international price comparison exercises would help to minimise the periodic shifts in the extreme poverty line. Also, while the World Bank\u2019s tool for calculating poverty levels, <a href=\"http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/index.htm\">PovcalNet, </a>is helpful, clearer information on the provenance of data and the methods and transformations used to convert countries\u2019 household survey data into global poverty statistics is needed. For example, country data currently mixes surveys asking about people\u2019s consumption with others (particularly in Latin America) enquiring about people\u2019s income, which is harder to measure and tends to be under reported.</p>\n<p><strong>A focus on closing country-level poverty data gaps:</strong> The World Bank was forced to draw on surveys for 17 countries that pre-dated 2005 for its 2011 global poverty estimates, adding to inaccuracies. Some 28 countries have no data collected that can be used. These are currently assigned the average poverty rate of each of these countries\u2019 region, even though many \u2013 Myanmar, Somalia, South Sudan and Zimbabwe \u2013 have suffered from recent conflict and instability and so might in reality have much higher poverty rates.</p>\n<p><strong>Agreed benchmarks for judging the end of poverty by 2030: </strong>Crossing such a low income threshold does not mean efforts can cease: being slightly above a single line provides no insurance against falling back into poverty, nor against wider forms of poverty and deprivation. Countries such as Uganda have seen income poverty fall yet a lack of development progress in areas such as maternal and child mortality. The World Bank has established the <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/commission-on-global-poverty\">Commission on Global Poverty</a> to consider whether wider measures of poverty \u2013 at different income levels and for other forms of deprivation \u2013 are needed.</p>\n<p><strong>Investment in national statistical systems: </strong>Countries\u2019 own statistics are the bedrock on which good global poverty data will be built. Systems taken for granted in developed countries produce weak or little data in developing countries, even on basic issues; for example, only 12 of 55 African countries have comprehensive birth registration. Immediate investment in national statistical systems is needed to allow regular and comprehensive censuses and timely and accurate surveys; long-term investment in civil registration and administrative systems is vital, including support for potential best practice such as Uganda\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.ubos.org/statistical-activities/community-systems/district-profiling/community-statistics/\">Community Information System</a>. Ultimately, to make poor people count, we need to count poor people.</p>\n<p><strong>A greater focus on poor people with more sub-national data:</strong> Understanding within-country trends is essential for ending poverty and leaving no-one behind, and focusing efforts on poverty below the national average.</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Functioning birth registration systems are lacking...", "author": [], "format": "Data blog", "date": "04 Sep 2015", "description": "Civil registration of births is essential for both statistical and administrative purposes.

The data collected is needed to determine population size and understand demographic trends. It is also important for policy making and planning, for example to plan regional health services based on accurate data on the number of people in a region.</p>\n<p>Without strong civil registration we cannot know exactly who and where people are, as is the case in many sub-Saharan countries.</p>\n<p>Development Initiatives has conducted some initial research into birth registration coverage of civil registration systems in 55 African countries. A fifth of countries (12/55) has a functional birth registration system, defined as birth registration covering over 75% of all births. One third of these countries are north African countries (Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria).</p>\n<p>Almost one third (16/55) have an operational system for birth registration, with coverage estimated between 40% and 75%.</p>\n<p>The majority of countries do not appear to have official registration systems in place, or have weak and unreliable systems. Almost half of countries (27/55) have weak or incomplete systems, meaning that less than 40% of births are estimated to be officially registered. These are mainly sub-Saharan countries.</p>\n<p>There is need for a <a href=\"http://www.undatarevolution.org/catalog/\">data revolution</a> to sustainably improve data systems for collecting vital statistics, including birth data. Investments in civil registration systems, and infrastructure to store and share data, are needed so that we can count people and make people count. \u00a0Efforts are already underway to improve civil registration. In February 2015, <a href=\"http://www.uneca.org/crmc3\">\u00a0African Ministers responsible for Civil Registration</a> committed to accelerate progress on civil registration-based vital statistics in the Yamoussoukro Declaration.</p>\n<p>Another key goal for a data revolution and national systems is to ensure that data is accessible. Indeed, the data collected through our research excludes information which may be held in hard copies by governments, but are not accessible online.</p>\n<p>For more information on the research process and on the Data Revolution, see <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/quantifying-the-challenges-facing-the-data-revolution-in-africa-a-first-attempt\">Bill Anderson\u2019s Data Blog</a> <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/quantifying-the-challenges-facing-the-data-revolution-in-africa-a-first-attempt\"><em>Quantifying the challenges facing the Data Revolution in Africa: A first attempt</em></a>.</p>\n</div><div class=\"row--cards\" ng-if=\"post.notes\">\n<div class=\"col-md-12 card m-b--2\">\n<div class=\"card__content bg--light\">\n<h3 class=\"h3\">Notes</h3>\n<div> <p><strong>Methodology</strong></p>\n<p>Our research assessed birth registration coverage of civil registration systems in 55 African countries.</p>\n<p>The only centralised databases available on birth civil registration are UN-related sources and take survey data into account.

By and large they do a good job. National Statistics Offices play a critical role in the government and development of all countries. In Africa, however, they do so against steep odds as very little actual data is available.</p>\n<p>In many countries the maternal mortality rate, for example, is <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3886639/\">calculated from an algorithm</a> that includes the GDP (calculated from an algorithm based on a <a href=\"http://africanarguments.org/2013/09/26/why-we-need-to-invest-in-african-development-statistics-from-a-diagnosis-of-africas-statistical-tragedy-towards-a-statistical-renaissance-by-morten-jerven/\">range of estimates</a>), the \u2018<a href=\"http://www.cpc.unc.edu/measure/prh/rh_indicators/specific/fertility/total-fertility-rate\">Fertility Rate</a>\u2019 (calculated from an algorithm based on births and age spans) and a statistic known as \u2018skilled attendance at birth\u2019 (calculated from survey estimates). The reason for this is that very few countries have mature, functioning Civil Registration Systems and Health Management Information Systems that can produce accurate vital statistics on the causes of death. Would this kind of methodology, happily accepted as part of the Millennium Development Goals, be acceptable to the governments and citizens of developed countries?</p>\n<p>The bread and butter of statisticians in developing countries is a 10-yearly population census and a variety of surveys based, generally, on relatively small samples. (Uganda has one of the continent\u2019s best national statistics systems, but its main survey <a href=\"http://catalog.ihsn.org/index.php/catalog/4620/study-description#page=sampling&amp;tab=study-desc\">covers only 1 in 1,000 households</a>.) This kind of data is useful for global databases, is generally funded and supervised by global institutions interested in globally comparable datasets and is currently critical for budgeting and planning departments in developing countries in the absence of anything better.</p>\n<p>But if we are going to take the global rhetoric of the Data Revolution seriously \u2013 \u201c<a href=\"http://www.undatarevolution.org/report/\">A World That Counts</a>\u201d, \u201cLeave No One Behind\u201d, and \u201cNo One should be Invisible\u201d \u2013 this isn\u2019t good enough. National and local decision makers need information based on data that is disaggregated down to the lowest level of administration. Small sample surveys won\u2019t tell you where poor people actually live. Small sample surveys don\u2019t allow for a health service to know where to best allocate its resources. Services are delivered through local authorities who need intelligence on their local communities to know how best to serve the people. Counting people to make people count is what the Data Revolution is about.</p>\n<p>This can only be achieved through investments in people and infrastructures to collect and produce registry and administrative data that delivers a continuous information service to governments and citizens alike. Surveys will always play an important role \u2013 to fill gaps and provide sense-checking quality control \u2013 but they cannot deliver a sustainable solution on their own. You can\u2019t heal a broken leg with sticking plasters.</p>\n<p>What then are the specific challenges facing African countries? There are currently two sources of comparative information that provide a good starting point. <a href=\"http://www.paris21.org/\">PARIS21</a> has collected data from a variety of sources to produce an extensive <a href=\"http://metabase.paris21.org/\">Metabase</a> containing statistical capacity profiles for all developing countries. The <a href=\"http://datatopics.worldbank.org/statisticalcapacity/\">World Bank Statistical Capacity Indicator</a> provides a 10-year timeline of 25 scores assessing methodology, data sources, periodicity and timeliness.</p>\n<p>At Development Initiatives we believe there is a need for a more granular and timely resource that reflects both best practice and challenges across all the data sources required to meet the needs of statisticians and the goals of the Data Revolution. This is our first attempt based on a preliminary desk study, which we hope to build upon through more in-depth country-based research. We have built a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h5e4YoUcty8CW0U9PLCp0JQS-Zs9OsGP5TYnnicBmc8/edit#gid=0\">table for all African countries</a> mapping nine indicators against a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h5e4YoUcty8CW0U9PLCp0JQS-Zs9OsGP5TYnnicBmc8/edit#gid=244230659\">simple traffic light system</a>. A table of <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h5e4YoUcty8CW0U9PLCp0JQS-Zs9OsGP5TYnnicBmc8/edit#gid=1234292631\">references</a> (for each cell in the table) is also provided. For comparison we have reproduced the World Bank\u2019s Statistical Capacity <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nzn3V1prTYjBJZ9U19JnANLeSq3iyURw4YlspNL01oA/edit#gid=2050644650\">Source Data</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nzn3V1prTYjBJZ9U19JnANLeSq3iyURw4YlspNL01oA/edit#gid=741226601\">Summary Scores</a> into a similar format.</p>\n<p>It needs to be stressed that the exercise that we have conducted is work in progress. The notes that follow highlight the problems collating the metadata, as much as they point to the actual data challenges we face.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Quantifying-African-Data-Challenges.png\"><img alt=\"Quantifying African Data Challenges\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9464\" height=\"370\" sizes=\"(max-width: 555px) 100vw, 555px\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Quantifying-African-Data-Challenges-555x370.png\" srcset=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Quantifying-African-Data-Challenges-555x370.png 555w, http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Quantifying-African-Data-Challenges-320x212.png 320w\" width=\"555\"/></a></p>\n<h3><strong>Censuses</strong></h3>\n<p>Basic data on <a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/vitstats/sets/Series_A_2014.pdf\">population censuses</a> is readily available and over 80% of countries have conducted a census in the last 10 years. More challenging is an assessment of the coverage and quality of the census and the availability of the data (particularly anonymised microdata that is disaggregated down to the lowest level of administration).</p>\n<h3><strong>Surveys</strong></h3>\n<p>As most surveys are driven by global institutions it is perhaps not surprising that they are well documented and the data provided. Performance, however, is not great. Only 45% of countries have conducted one or another form of household survey in the last 3 years. According to the World Bank only 33% have conducted more than 2 poverty-related surveys in the past 10 years. And only 20% have conducted an agricultural survey in the past 3 years.</p>\n<h3><strong>Civil registration</strong></h3>\n<p>The only credible way to count people on an ongoing basis is through civil registration \u2013 not only by documenting the events but by producing usable vital statistics. This is undoubtedly the biggest challenge facing the Data Revolution. The excellent World Bank <a href=\"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2014/05/19581045/global-civil-registration-vital-statistics-scaling-up-investment-plan-2015-2024\">report</a> on scaling up investment in civil registration and vital statistics highlights the crisis. At the same time however <a href=\"http://www.uneca.org/crmc3\">substantial efforts</a> are being made across Africa to deal with this. Data on the current state of progress is surprisingly difficult to obtain. The UN Statistics Division collects metadata on the status of systems through its <a href=\"http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/dyb/dyb%20questionnaires/Q/Country-Name_VT15_2015_E.xls\">Vital Statistics Questionnaire</a> but doesn\u2019t publish it. <a href=\"http://213.55.79.31/statcom/2011/assd/EN-PreliminaryReportCRVS.pdf\">Assessments of progress</a> from Africa often make it difficult to distinguish between planned and actual achievements and the World Bank indicator is too binary and provides simplistic overview. So while the World Bank reports that only four African countries have \u2018complete\u2019 systems. Our tentative research indicates that 50% of countries have made progress including data from the registration of births in vital statistics, and 11 countries have at least partially functioning systems for registering deaths.</p>\n<h3><strong>Administrative systems</strong></h3>\n<p>All ministries and government agencies collect data for planning, budgeting, operations and monitoring. In most instances these datasets are non-standard and inconsistent. Turning the efforts that go into these unstructured practices into sustainable, usable statistics is the second big challenge faced by the Data Revolution. Data on the status of such systems or datasets is extremely difficult to collate, a reflection of the disregard currently shown to these systems. In our first attempt we have looked at Health and Education Management Information Systems (which typically record staff, logistics and performance in all health and education facilities). We attempted to investigate Land and Agricultural Management but failed to find sufficient data.</p>\n<h3><strong>Other data</strong></h3>\n<p>Our work highlights some of the key data sources underpinning development statistics. It is far from exhaustive. Satellite data, mobile phone metadata, feedback loops, academic, private sector and citizen data should all be included in a comprehensive assessment.</p>\n<h3><strong>Methodologies</strong></h3>\n<p>As important as the data are the methodologies employed to convert source data into meaningful statistics. Of particular importance is an understanding of how methodologies change and statistics are rebased as and when better data from new sources becomes available.</p>\n<h3><strong>The start of a journey</strong></h3>\n<p>This work is being carried out in the belief that unless we continue to map out the specific challenges facing the Data Revolution (and the successes) a lot of financial and human resources are going to go to waste. We trust that our second attempt will be more accurate and purposeful.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Quantifying-Data-Revolution-Challenges-in-Africa.xlsx\">Download our table for all African countries as an Excel file.</a></p>\n<p>Research by Manon Simeon, Rosanna Collins and Guto Ifan.</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Half as much aid goes to sanitation than water wit...", "author": [], "format": "Data blog", "date": "28 Aug 2015", "description": "Source: OECD CRS The year 2015 marks the deadline for the Millennium Development Goals (MDG).

Volumes of aid loans to water and sanitation increased steadily from US$1.1\u00a0billion in 2003 to US$3.3\u00a0billion in 2013. This is an increase of 205%, compared with a 123% increase for grants over the same period. Aid grants to the sector have remained relatively stable since 2005; US$3.1\u00a0billion in 2005 and US$3.3\u00a0billion in 2013, an increase of only US$157.5\u00a0million. Therefore, the <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/recent-decline-in-share-of-aid-to-the-water-and-sanitation-sector-could-compromise-progress-to-universal-access\">increasing total volume of aid to water and sanitation</a> is driven by aid loans.</p>\n<p>The share of loans in aid to the sector has increased, from less than a third in 2005 to over half of aid since 2011. In 2013, 50.2% of aid to the water and sanitation sector came as loans and equity. This is a very large share compared with other social sectors. The health sector receives only 6% of aid as loans, and the education sector receives 14%.</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<h3>Aid loans to water and sanitation go mainly to large systems projects</h3>\n<p>Between 2011 and 2013 large systems projects received on average two-thirds (64%) of all aid loans to the water and sanitation sector. [2] While bilateral donors mainly provide aid to the water and sanitation sector as grants, multilateral donors mainly provide it as loans. In 2013, more than two-thirds (68%) of multilateral aid to the sector was delivered as loans. A key driver of growth in aid to the water and sanitation sector has therefore been the increase in multilateral lending to large systems.</p>\n<p>Download the data in\u00a0<a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Data-blog-Loans-represent-a-growing-share-of-aid-to-water-and-sanitation-EXCEL.xlsx\">Excel</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Data-blog-Loans-represent-a-growing-share-of-aid-to-water-and-sanitation-CSV1.csv\">CSV</a>\u00a0format</p>\n<p>For more information see the <a href=\"http://www.wateraid.org/what-we-do/our-approach/research-and-publications/view-publication?id=0cad195c-1701-4466-959c-7cc7907732d1\"><em>WaterAid report 2015:</em> <em>Essential element</em><em>: why international aid for water, sanitation and hygiene is still a critical source of finance for many countries</em></a>, which is based on analysis by Development Initiatives.</p>\n<p>For more information on aid loans, see our report <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/oda-loans-tracking-a-growing-source-of-development-financing\"><em>ODA loans \u2013 tracking a growing source of development financing</em></a></p>\n<p><em>\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\">[1]</a> Several elements affect the <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/oda-loans-tracking-a-growing-source-of-development-financing\">level of concessionality</a>, including interest rate, which must be lower than the prevailing market rate, and the repayment period.

But 748\u00a0million people (10% of the global population) remain without access to improved water sources.[3] Progress to improve sanitation was not sufficient to meet the MDG sanitation target: 75% of the global population with access to improved sanitation facilities.[4] Globally, 2.5 billion people (40% of the population) remain without access to sanitation facilities.[5]</p>\n<h3>Aid has played an important role in financing improved access to water and sanitation</h3>\n<p>Global volumes of aid to water and sanitation increased from US$2.6\u00a0billion in 2003 to US$6.6 billion in 2013.<sup><sup>[6]</sup></sup> Aid flows to water and sanitation reached a 10-year high in 2013, recording a steady growth from 2007. Between 2003 and 2013, aid to water and sanitation grew by 158%, outpacing the growth of overall aid to all sectors, which recorded 87% growth.</p>\n<h3>But\u00a0more recent years show a reverse in this tendency</h3>\n<p>Between 2011 and 2013 aid to water and sanitation grew by only 2.5%, falling behind the pace of overall aid, which grew by 10.7%. In line with these trends, the share of aid going to water and sanitation decreased between 2012 and 2013. In 2013, the share of aid to the sector dropped to only 3.9% of overall aid, falling below 4% for the first time since 2009.</p>\n<h3>Water and sanitation financing should be improved following unmet MDG targets</h3>\n<p>A majority (80%) of developing countries had insufficient current finance to meet MDG targets for drinking water and sanitation, according to the <a href=\"http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/glaas/2014/en/\">UN Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS) 2014 survey\u00a0of 94 developing countries</a>.[7] To meet the SDG target of universal access to water and sanitation, countries that lack finance to meet MDG targets will experience an even greater finance gap.

These flows to the largest 20 humanitarian recipients have more than trebled since 2000, reaching US$213 billion in 2013. They comprise a mix of resources, for example remittances, official development assistance (ODA) and humanitarian assistance (see figure). Despite increasing just under five-fold between 2000 and 2013, international humanitarian assistance forms a comparatively small percentage of these flows, but remains a vital source of assistance to such countries.</p>\n<p>Yet resources (including ODA) have not necessarily gone to the most vulnerable countries. While eight of the largest humanitarian recipients between 2004 and 2013 fall within the largest 20 recipients of ODA, a further eight (Sudan, Lebanon, Zimbabwe, Syria, Chad, Somalia, South Sudan and Myanmar) are outside the largest 40 ODA recipients.

It can target those most in need, address their immediate requirements and combat the underlying determinants of poor nutrition in the longer term.</p>\n<p>In our recent report, <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/dfids-aid-spending-for-nutrition-2013\"><em>DFID\u2019s aid spending for nutrition: 2013</em></a>, we analysed the UK\u2019s Department for International Development (DFID)\u2019s spending for nutrition using an agreed approach and found that it has increased its total nutrition ODA spending substantially between 2010 and 2013:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>DFID disbursed a total of US$840 million of nutrition ODA in 2013; this is a major increase (74%) from the previous year\u2019s spending of US$482 million, which is in line with an upward trend since 2010 (the period covered by the analysis).</li>\n<li>In 2013 DFID disbursed US$105 million to nutrition-specific activities and an additional US$735 million to nutrition-sensitive projects. Both DFID\u2019s nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive spending has increased annually \u2013 by 163% and 142%, respectively, since 2010.</li>\n<li>The scale of DFID\u2019s nutrition-sensitive ODA is consistently greater than its nutrition-specific spending \u2013 more than 7 times greater over the period.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Tracking nutrition aid</h3>\n<p>Tracking donor ODA for improving nutrition is important to understand how much they spend and where these resources go, for leveraging additional investments from other actors, and to facilitate accountability at all levels.</p>\n<p>Tracking is also a challenge. Most approaches begin with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC) Creditor Reporting System (CRS), to which DAC member countries report their ODA spending in detail using prescriptive \u2018sector\u2019 and \u2018purpose\u2019 categories and codes. These allow the identification of nutrition-specific interventions. To identify and track donor spending on broader nutrition-sensitive interventions, there have emerged various efforts to capture other relevant activities amongst the established CRS reporting system. Perhaps the most widely endorsed approach for doing so is the <a href=\"http://scalingupnutrition.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/RESOURCE_TRACKING_METHODOLOGY_SUN_DONOR_NETWORK.pdf\">SUN Donor Network approach</a>, used here and adopted by several donors to report spending to the <a href=\"http://globalnutritionreport.org/\">Global Nutrition Report.</a></p>\n<p>The accurate tracking of all donors\u2019 spending plays a vital role in combating malnutrition by increasing accountability and providing essential knowledge to better allocate resources. The picture on who is spending what, where and when on nutrition should continue to improve. This could be achieved by better reporting by donors, clearer information on domestic public resources and more accountability from other public and private sources of finance.</p>\n<p>For more detail on this methodology and for more findings, see <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/dfids-aid-spending-for-nutrition-2013\">DFID\u2019s aid spending for nutrition: 2013</a>.</p>\n<p>Download the data in <a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/DFID_aid_for_nutrition.xlsx\">Excel</a> and <a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/DFID_aid_for_nutrition.csv\">CSV</a></p>\n</div><div class=\"row--cards\" ng-if=\"post.notes\">\n<div class=\"col-md-12 card m-b--2\">\n<div class=\"card__content bg--light\">\n<h3 class=\"h3\">Notes</h3>\n<div> <p>DFID disburses the majority of the UK\u2019s ODA, including for nutrition \u2013 83% of the UK\u2019s total ODA and 95% of the UK\u2019s nutrition-specific ODA in 2013.</p>\n<p>Whilst this analysis gives insight into DFID\u2019s nutrition spending, it is not able to consider the degree to which different nutrition-specific or nutrition-sensitive actions are effective at improving nutrition outcomes.</p>\n<p>All values are based on ODA disbursements and presented in constant 2013 prices.</p>\n<p><strong>Source</strong></p>\n<p>Development Initiatives based on OECD DAC CRS</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Meeting the need for better financing data to info...", "author": [], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "04 Aug 2015", "description": "We know that global financing for humanitarian preparedness and response is much bigger and more complex than the limited picture we are able to see from e", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/meeting-the-need-for-better-financing-data-to-inform-decisions-during-a-crisis-what-can-the-whs-deliver/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>We know that global financing for humanitarian preparedness and response is much bigger and more complex than the limited picture we are able to see from existing reporting platforms. There is no global reporting system for domestic government expenditure on humanitarian assistance and therefore no reliable total for these contributions. Many international donors do not report their allocations to existing reporting platforms and private contributions are also often missing. The current set-up makes it difficult to gain a holistic picture of financing for crisis-affected countries across different spheres, such as development, humanitarian, security and climate adaptation \u2013 and to understand what people are actually receiving.</p>\n<p>Improving the financial data available in humanitarian crises is essential to increase operational effectiveness. Better reporting would improve transparency in terms of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the <strong>totality</strong> of funding, including resources beyond humanitarian assistance</li>\n<li><strong>traceability</strong> beyond the first-level recipient to see the transaction chain from donor to crisis-affected person and the time it takes for the money to work its way through the system</li>\n<li><strong>timeliness</strong> to allow real-time data on available resources in fast-moving humanitarian settings.<a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\"><sup><sup>[i]</sup></sup></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Commitments to use and improve existing systems and tools for publishing data on development and humanitarian financing, such as the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI), would bring immediate results. Improvements to the IATI standard currently in progress mean that by the end of 2015 it will be fully compatible and interoperable with the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)\u2019s Financial Tracking Service (FTS) and other aid coordination platforms.</p>\n<p>This revolutionary step-change in the availability of information during an emergency depends on one key commitment: the preparedness of donors and other agencies to publish and refresh their data on humanitarian activities in a regular and timely fashion, particularly in sudden onset and rapidly escalating emergencies, when daily updating is critical to allow a real-time picture of the changing funding situation.<a href=\"#_edn2\" name=\"_ednref2\">[ii]</a></p>\n<p>The WHS should seek a clear commitment from all stakeholders to agree to this by the end of 2016 and to put in place a roadmap for implementation.

However, in order to assess their impact on ODA portfolios we have undertaken new analysis that looks at donor trends over time, the impacts of changing rules, and the implications for developing countries.</p>\n<h3>What would ODA have looked like in 2013 if the new loans rules had applied?</h3>\n<p>We compared the levels of net ODA reported by donors in 2013 to the amount of ODA that donors would have reported if the new rules had applied in that year. In aggregate the differences are not large: we find there would have been overall a 4-5% increase in the level of ODA reported by DAC donors in 2013. Most donors would see a relatively small change in the total value of their aid, amounting to no more than a US$10 million alteration in each case.</p>\n<p>However, some key donor portfolios would look significantly different.</p>\n<h3>Some donor totals would fall\u2026</h3>\n<p>A few donors would see their overall ODA totals drop by applying the new rules to 2013 volumes. Germany would see the biggest decrease of all donors in the total volume of its 2013 ODA \u2013 losing 5.4% (US$770million) from the total; France would have reported $445 million less \u2013 a fall of 3.9%.</p>\n<p>The reason for this is that these donors\u2019 loans have relatively low levels of concessionality and, under the new rules, loans with higher levels of concessionality count for more ODA than those with lower levels.</p>\n<h3>\u2026while a few would rise</h3>\n<p>Japan would see the biggest overall impact to its 2013 aid from the new rules with a significant increase of 56.3% in value, worth an extra US$6.5 billion added to the Japanese ODA total. This would mean Japan becoming the 2nd largest donor overall. Japan\u2019s ODA loans are among the most concessional of any DAC donor. Also, Japan receives more in repayments on existing loans than any other DAC donor. Under the current rules these repayments are subtracted from the headline ODA figure, but this will not be the case under the new rules.</p>\n<p>Some other donors would see smaller increases: ODA from the United States (US) would increase by US$536 million, a 1.7% increase. (The US no longer gives ODA loans; again, this change is accounted for by the fact that repayments will no longer be subtracted from the total). Spain would also have reported an additional US$228 million, a 9.6% increase. Complete information on the potential effect of the new rules for all donors can be found in our <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/oda-loans-tracking-a-growing-source-of-development-financing\">report</a>.</p>\n<h3>What are the implications of these changes?</h3>\n<p>It is impossible to know how the proposed changes will actually affect allocation. DAC allocation decision-making is being affected by the new rules as we write, and the patterns of ODA lending we see in 2014 and 2015 data may well look quite different.</p>\n<p>Yet, this analysis is still instructive. It gives an indication of the kind of incentives that might influence DAC donors as they continue to negotiate and finalise the changes to concessional loan rules within the DAC in 2015. Some issues, such as how to factor in debt relief and interest repayments into the totals, are still being resolved. Further attention therefore needs to be given to the potential impact of ODA loans and incentives for donors, especially relating to the possible outcomes for their partner countries.</p>\n<h3>Learn more</h3>\n<p>This data comes from the recently published report,<strong>\u00a0\u2018</strong><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/oda-loans-tracking-a-growing-source-of-development-financing\">ODA Loans \u2013 tracking a growing source of development financing</a>\u2018.

The\u00a0 UN Secretary General\u2019s High Level Panel on Humanitarian Financing is just beginning its work, against the backdrop of World Humanitarian Summit discussions and the run-up to the Financing for Development discussions in Addis next month. As we note in this year\u2019s GHA report, humanitarian financing is in the spotlight like never before. In this context, the 2015 United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) Humanitarian Affairs Segment (HAS) \u2013 held last week during 17 to 19 June \u2013 offered an important opportunity to discuss the future of financing to address crisis, vulnerability and risk in the context of new evidence and ideas.</p>\n<p>The\u00a0 <a href=\"http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/report/gha-report-2014\">Global Humanitarian Assistance (GHA) programme</a> together with Future Humanitarian Financing (FHF) organised a side event at ECOSOC HAS on 18 June, \u2018<em>Interactive Dialogue on Humanitarian Financing\u2019,</em> which proceeded and fed into the official ECOSOC HAS High Level Panel on \u2018<em>Addressing capacity and resource challenges through humanitarian </em><em>financing\u2019, </em>chaired by Stephen O\u2019Brien, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator. A cross-section of actors participated in the event \u2013 including donors, government representatives, representatives from multilateral agencies, non-governmental organisations and the private sector.</p>\n<p>Assistant Secretary-General and Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator Kyung-wha Kang opened the event, highlighting the growing gap between humanitarian requirements and available resources and the need to address this through not only strengthened sufficiency of funding but also more effective use of funds. She highlighted the need to find new solutions to old problems by scaling up multi-year planning and increased coordination with development actors; diversifying the funding base to include the private sector and Islamic financing; and the promotion of risk financing and investments in emergency preparedness to meet peak demands.</p>\n<p>In response to presentations from Sophia Swithern on up-to-date trends in humanitarian financing \u2013 drawing upon the recently launched <a href=\"http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/report/gha-report-2015\">2015 GHA report</a> \u2013 and from Lydia Poole on findings from FHF\u2019s recent report \u2018<em>Looking Beyond the Crisis\u2019, panellists discussed </em>the way forward for future humanitarian financing.</p>\n<p>Discussions between panellists focussed on issues relating to the financing of local and national responses, the need to develop a shared responsibility between development and wider actors financing responses in crisis-affected countries to address the underlying causes of vulnerability, the need to move towards more anticipatory ways of working, and reducing inefficiencies present within the current system.</p>\n<p>The event was chaired by Anke Reiffenstuel, Deputy Head Task Force Humanitarian Aid, Ministry of Foreign Affairs Germany, and panellists included:</p>\n<p><strong>Robert Piper</strong>, UN Regional Humanitarian Coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territories (oPt)</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\u201cDemand is outstripping supply; we mustn\u2019t focus exclusively on raising more money, but reduce the demand in first place\u201d</em></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Claus Sorenson</strong>, Director General, European Commission\u2019s Department for Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection (ECHO)</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\u201cA key issue in the humanitarian system is an attitude problem; humanitarians must get out of their holes, stop hiding behind their principles and engage more with political communities to address\u00a0fundamental underlying issues\u201d</em></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Thomas Gass</strong>, Assistant Secretary-General for Policy Coordination and Inter-Agency Affairs in UN DESA</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\u201cThe humanitarian community needs to own the post-2015 agenda and develop a shared responsibility with the development community for addressing vulnerability and people\u2019s long-term needs\u2019</em></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Fatou Diagne Zaouini</strong>, Risk Management Advisor, Africa Risk Capacity</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\u201cFor every dollar insured by government for risk financing, the international humanitarian community should commit to matching this\u201d.</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>The panel event was then followed by discussions amongst the side-event attendees who worked in groups to develop recommendations on the future of humanitarian financing under five key themes that were central to discussions on the panel and to those taking place as part of the World Humanitarian Summit (WHS) and the UN High Level Panel on Humanitarian Financing. The group themes included \u2018nationalising and localising the humanitarian response\u2019, \u2018the development and humanitarian nexus\u2019, \u2018embracing diversity to ensure sufficient funding\u2019, \u2018moving towards proactive ways of working to better meet peak demands\u2019 and \u2018upgrading the humanitarian architecture to address inefficiencies and strengthen needs-based funding\u2019.</p>\n<p>The recommendations that resulted from the group work were presented by Anke Reiffenstuel, Deputy Head Task Force Humanitarian Aid, Ministry of Foreign Affairs Germany, to the official ECOSOC HAS High Level Panel on \u2018<em>Addressing capacity and resource challenges through humanitarian </em><em>financing\u2019 </em>in order to inform discussions and feed into the conclusions from the panel.</p>\n<h3>The recommendations emerging from the five groups are outlined below.</h3>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Group A: Nationalising and Localising Humanitarian Response:</span></strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>A change in the national humanitarian architecture is needed to ensure local and national actors\u2019 strategic involvement in context-appropriate coordination mechanisms.

This UK-hosted summit focussed on transforming political commitments into practical action. It was built on the foundations of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/274724/A_DECLARATION_OF_COMMITMENT_TO_END_SEXUAL_VIOLENCE_IN_CONFLICT.pdf\">Declaration of Commitment to End Sexual Violence in Conflict</a> , launched by the UK government in September 2013, and the November 2013 Call to Action on Protecting Girls and Women in Emergencies\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/256872/Final_Communique_v_11_Nov_4.pdf\">Communiqu\u00e9</a>. To date, 140 governments have endorsed the declaration and 32 governments are signatory to the Communiqu\u00e9.</p>\n<p>The global summit, declaration and Communiqu\u00e9 all led to agreements to strengthen funding to respond to sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV). The global summit recommended: \u201c<em>Donors need to make longer-term funding commitments (beyond one year) in order to build necessary systems and long-term engagement with communities; funds should be made accessible for local level organisations and leveraged from other areas.\u201d </em>[i]</p>\n<p>Funding pledges totalling <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/j/prm/policyissues/issues/c62379.htm\">over $US41 million</a> were made publically by donors as a result of the Communiqu\u00e9 \u00a0and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/390742/PSVI_post_summit_report_Online2.pdf\">over US$15 million</a> as an outcome of the global summit.</p>\n<h3>Have these global agreements increased funding for action on SGBV?</h3>\n<p><strong>Funding to address SGBV remains low though has increased between 2012 and 2014</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/123.jpg\"><img alt=\"Figure 1\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6408 size-full\" height=\"290\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/123.jpg\" width=\"606\"/></a></p>\n<p>Figure 1: Total humanitarian funding for action on SGBV, 2011\u20132014</p>\n<p><em>Source: Development Initiatives based on UN OCHA FTS data</em></p>\n<p><em>Note: Funding analysis captures SGBV-related projects reported to UN OCHA\u2019s FTS. As there is currently no identifier or marker specifically for SGBV in the FTS, a keyword search was undertaken on project titles and descriptions. Thus, the analysis may not capture all SGBV-related funding, particularly where activities are mainstreamed across all other programmes, and/or where funding falls outside of humanitarian spending (ie what is reported to the FTS).</em></p>\n<p>Figure 1 shows that humanitarian assistance for action on SGBV doubled from US$50 million in 2012 to US$107 million in 2014. The increase in funding during this period mirrors the growth of political attention to, and policy commitments related to, SGBV from 2013, culminating in the global summit in 2014.</p>\n<p>Funding to SGBV increased from US$93 million in 2013 to US$107 million in 2014, illustrating an increase of US$14 million during the year from the signing of the Communiqu\u00e9 in 2013. This is less than a third of the total pledged by donors following the Communiqu\u00e9 (over US$41 million).</p>\n<p>Despite the rise in funding to address SGBV overall, it continues to be low, and only constituted 0.6% of total humanitarian assistance reported to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affair (OCHA)\u2019s Financial Tracking Service (FTS) in 2013, decreasing slightly to 0.5% in 2014.</p>\n<p>Levels of funding to address SGBV may, however, be higher than these reported figures. This may be because SGBV activities that are mainstreamed within other programmes are not captured in this analysis. This analysis has largely only captured projects that include an explicit reference to SGBV (or related terms) in the project description as it is not possible to capture mainstreamed spending on SGBV using current reporting mechanisms. Also, additional SGBV activities may be funded through non-humanitarian activities (i.e. development or stabilisation activities) that are not captured in the FTS and are beyond the focus of this analysis.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, just under half of SGBV funding (49%) identified in this analysis was not coded using the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) gender marker in 2014 (but captured through Global Humanitarian Assistance coding). Poor reporting on gender using the IASC gender marker is a challenge across humanitarian funding more broadly. In 2014, less than a third (62%) of all humanitarian funding reported to UN OCHA\u2019s FTS was not coded using the gender marker. As a result, it is difficult to track the delivery of policy commitments on gender and SGBV.</p>\n<p><strong>South Sudan was the largest recipient of SGBV-related funding in 2014</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/gender-briefing-fig-2.jpg\"><img alt=\"Figure 2\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6407 size-full\" height=\"311\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/gender-briefing-fig-2.jpg\" width=\"606\"/></a></p>\n<p>Figure 2: Top ten recipients of SGBV funding, 2013\u20132014</p>\n<p><em>Source: Development Initiatives based on UN OCHA FTS</em></p>\n<p>Based on the available data, South Sudan was the largest recipient of humanitarian assistance for SGBV-related projects, receiving US$21.2 million in 2014, almost three times as much as the next largest recipient Iraq (US$7.2 million). It overtook funding received by the largest recipients in 2013, Syria and Somalia (US$19.1 million and US$12.6 million respectively). Yemen received US$6.7 million and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), often the focus of global SGBV attention, US$5.4 million (an increase of 22% from 2013).</p>\n<p><strong>The way forward</strong></p>\n<p>To ensure the momentum built from last year\u2019s Call to Action and Global Summit is not lost, it is critical that donors meet the funding pledges made and continue to channel funding towards the goal of addressing SGBV against women, girls, boys and men in emergencies. This would also align with the proposed post-2015 sustainable development goals\u2019 stand-alone goal on gender equality.</p>\n<p>Better reporting is also needed so the levels of funding can be properly understood and tracked. Two improvements would facilitate this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Better reporting using the IASC marker. </strong>As noted in our briefing note on \u2018<a href=\"http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/report/funding-gender-emergencies-trends\">Funding gender in emergencies</a>\u2019, a mandatory commitment from all donors to use this marker when reporting on humanitarian spending to the UNOCHA\u2019s\u00a0FTS \u2013 for UN appeals and more widely \u2013 would help to better track overall funding for gender equality and so help to identify SGBV funding within this.</li>\n<li><strong>Adopting a code for reporting on funding that is specifically targeted at addressing SGBV </strong>within the existing IASC gender marker and/or within the FTS. This would help to identify specific funding to address SBGV whether for mainstreamed or standalone projects and to track commitments against pledges.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Methodology</strong></p>\n<p>Funding analysis captures SGBV-related projects reported to UN OCHA\u2018s FTS.

We estimate that over a third of aid targeting persons with disabilities are projects in the health sector, though other sectors feature prominently. Enhanced reporting standards would help ensure improved tracking of aid targeting persons with disabilities, including by sector.</p>\n<p>An estimated 1 billion people globally live with a disability. Persons with disabilities are thought to be over-represented among the poor. [1] However, it is currently challenging to track the investments aid donors make towards improving the lives of persons with disabilities, even though aid is thought to be a critical resource for supporting the needs of this group. [4]</p>\n<h3>Finding out how much aid is spent on persons with disabilities is challenging</h3>\n<p>Data on disability-related aid investments is lacking. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)\u2019s Creditor Reporting System (CRS) does not provide clear and comprehensive data on aid projects related to disabilities. While there is a specific marker for <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/gender-relevance-known-half-aid-2012\">gender-related projects</a>, there is no such marker for disability.</p>\n<p>Neither are there specific sector codes for reporting disability-relevant aid projects.</p>\n<p>Two sectors refer to disabilities \u2013 \u2018human rights\u2019 and \u2018social welfare/services\u2019 \u2013 but also cover other disadvantaged groups, such as religious minorities or migrants. Two other sectors that could be strongly related to disability include \u2018landmines\u2019 and \u2018relief and rehabilitation\u2019.[2]</p>\n<h3>What we found</h3>\n<p>A search of CRS project descriptions for disability-related terms shows 1,719 disability-relevant aid projects in 2013, worth US$610 million. [3] These projects cover many sectors. Health accounts for more than a third (38%) of the total. \u2018Other social services\u2019, including \u2018social welfare/services\u2019, accounts for just a fifth (21%), with \u2018education\u2019 and \u2018governance and security\u2019 also prominent. The four sectors identified as relevant to persons with disabilities account for less than a third of the total disability-relevant aid projects identified in the word search.</p>\n<h3>How could data on aid to persons with disabilities be improved?</h3>\n<p>In two key ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Explicitly consider persons in planning stages of aid-funded projects</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Donors should consider how disadvantaged groups, including persons with disabilities, stand to benefit from aid projects at the planning stage and plan to qualitatively and quantitatively report on the impacts.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Improving reporting on projects</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Disaggregated data on financing available to persons with disabilities can support more informed decision-making on international and domestic investments. Our word search-based findings rely on the quality of donors\u2019 reporting. More detailed project-level reporting, or a disability marker in the CRS (similar to that which exists for gender and climate-relevant aid projects), could help improve data for tracking aid investments to this important disadvantaged group.</p>\n<p>Download the data in <a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Aid-relevant-to-persons-with-disabilities-2013.xlsx\">Excel</a> and <a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Aid-relevant-to-persons-with-disabilities-2013.csv\">CSV</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</div><div class=\"row--cards\" ng-if=\"post.notes\">\n<div class=\"col-md-12 card m-b--2\">\n<div class=\"card__content bg--light\">\n<h3 class=\"h3\">Notes</h3>\n<div> <p>Data are gross official development assistance (ODA) disbursements to all eligible recipients from Development Assistance Committee (DAC) donors, non-DAC donors and multilateral organisations reporting to the OECD CRS.</p>\n<p>\u201cOther sectors\u201d include water &amp; sanitation, banking &amp; business, industry &amp; trade, infrastructure, agriculture &amp; food security, environment, other and undefined.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The World Health Organization and World Bank estimated the number of people with disabilities at 978 million people in the 2011 <a href=\"http://www.who.int/disabilities/world_report/2011/en/\">World Report on Disability</a>, or 15% of the global population, based on 2004 data.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>See the OECD DAC\u2019s list of <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/dacandcrscodelists.htm\">sector codes</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\u201cAid projects\u201d here refer to individual CRS records which could be aid activities or aid projects.

DI\u2019s latest report on social protection financing and coverage shows that increases in official development assistance (ODA) will be needed.</p>\n<p>Our <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/oda-to-ldcs-target-what-do-the-data-tell-us\">recent data blog</a> shows that LDCs face complex challenges in ending poverty that may require sustained support and investment from ODA providers. The role of social protection programmes in ending poverty has seen increasing support in recent years, from both the international community and national governments. Target 1.3 in the (under Goal 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere)\u00a0 is to \u201cimplement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable.\u201d As our<a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/getting-poverty-to-zero-financing-for-social-protection-in-least-developed-countries\"> report </a>shows, for LDCs, funding and delivering on this target will be a significant but not impossible challenge.</p>\n<p>There is a growing body of evidence on the impact that social protection has on reducing poverty in countries as diverse as Brazil, Ethiopia, South Africa, Malawi, Kenya, India and Rwanda. All countries now have at least one type of social protection programme targeted at the poorest and most vulnerable people.</p>\n<p>However, in LDCs, we find social protection programmes are on average only reaching 20% of those living in extreme poverty (below PPP $1.25 a day). Only 10 of the 48 LDCs have coverage of more than 30% and these tend to be countries with lower levels of poverty. Even where extremely poor people are reached, the level of transfer is much less than that needed to sustainably lift poor people out of extreme poverty \u2013 just 10% in sub-Saharan Africa. Significant additional financial resources are needed in most LDCs.</p>\n<h3><strong>ODA for social protection: current spending</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Data-blog-SP-Fig-1.png\"><img alt=\"Data blog - SP - Fig 1\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8719\" height=\"889\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Data-blog-SP-Fig-1.png\" width=\"1491\"/></a></p>\n<p>We analysed financing support from Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC) donors for all forms of social protection-related programmes. We deliberately developed a broad definition of social protection so as not to overestimate the funding gap. Using this broad definition the current annual spend on social protection ODA is US7.7 billion in 2013 (excluding US$0.7 billion on technical cooperation).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Figure-8-social-protection-data-blog.png\"><img alt=\"Figure 8 social protection data blog\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8717\" height=\"841\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Figure-8-social-protection-data-blog.png\" width=\"1231\"/></a></p>\n<p>In 2013, the five donors providing most social protection aid \u2013 accounting for around 80% of total spend \u2013 were the US, UK, the EU, the International Development Association and Japan. The next five are Canada, Germany, World Food Programme, Norway and Australia.</p>\n<p>As a sector, ODA spending on social protection has consistently accounted for a\u00a0 lower percentage of total ODA than either education or health has, never rising to more than 12% of the total ODA spend from DAC donors.</p>\n<h3><strong>Domestic financed expenditure in LDCs can\u2019t fill financing gap</strong></h3>\n<p>The cost of providing the transfer needed to close the extreme poverty gap in LDCs is US$49 per person per year, taking into account start up and administration costs and allowing for leakage. This is less than the costs for the education and health sustainable development goals, US$60 and US$86 respectively.</p>\n<p>Current domestic spending on all forms of social protection programmes is on average US$10 per person in LDCs, equivalent to just over 1% of GDP. If, for example, LDCs increased their tax to gross domestic product (GDP) ratio to 20% (from the current average of 17%) and allocated 10% to targeted social protection programmes, spending would rise to 2% of GDP, US$16 per person. Yet even in this scenario, there would still be a funding gap of US$33 per person in LDCs.</p>\n<p>Current DAC donor funding for all forms of social protection-related programmes in LDCs averages US$4 per person per year. As a result we estimate 88% of the financing gap is currently unfunded. (This compares with recent estimates of the unfunded element for education at 67% and health 50%.)</p>\n<h3><strong>An increase in ODA will be needed to support LDCs to deliver the post-2015 goal of ending poverty \u00a0</strong></h3>\n<p>Our analysis suggests the increase in ODA required to deliver social protection programmes at the scale needed to end poverty in all LDCs is equivalent to 0.1% of OECD DAC donors\u2019 gross national income (GNI). Given the priority attached to ending extreme poverty and the limited scope for LDCs to increase domestic resources for funding social protection in the next 15 years, financing for social protection should be high on the agenda for governments preparing for the UN Financing for Development (FFD3) conference this July, as ambitious financing commitments from all actors will be essential.</p>\n<p>Further, identifying the domestic actions and the international cooperation that will be required to support delivery and increase coverage and scale-up of social protection in LDCs should be high priority. This needs to be considered at global, regional and national levels, as part of UN post-2015 sustainable development negotiations and post-2015 implementation.</p>\n<p>Download the data in <a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Copy-of-Data-Financing-for-social-protection-in-LDC.xlsx\">Excel</a>\u00a0and CSV \u2013 <a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Copy-of-Data-Financing-for-social-protection-in-LDC.csv\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Copy-of-Data-Financing-for-social-protection-in-LDC-2.csv\">Figure 8</a></p>\n</div><div class=\"row--cards\" ng-if=\"post.notes\">\n<div class=\"col-md-12 card m-b--2\">\n<div class=\"card__content bg--light\">\n<h3 class=\"h3\">Notes</h3>\n<div> <p><strong>Methodology:</strong></p>\n<p>For the purposes of this report we have adopted a broad defintion of social protection.

But ending poverty requires a shift of focus towards the needs of the world\u2019s poorest people rather than countries. <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/ending-poverty-by-focusing-on-the-poorest-20-of-people-globally\">We have argued for</a> an explicit focus on improving the prospects and opportunities for the poorest 20% of people globally and monitoring of their progress. This will help mobilise the resources, investments, partnerships and cooperation needed to realise the 2030 goal of ending extreme poverty.</p>\n<p>The current country-based allocation system for official development assistance (ODA) is <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#%21/post/improvingoda2015\">inadequate</a> and <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#%21/post/income-status-basis-aid-allocation-decisions\">needs to become more sophisticated</a>. But until we have the sub-national data needed to accurately target the poor, LDCs \u2013 a UN-recognised group of currently 48 countries \u2013 are a readily available option for channelling resources to poorer people. LDC status is based on low income per capita and assessments of low human assets and economic vulnerability. LDCs are home to a third of people living in the poorest 20% globally, and <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/poverty-of-people-in-the-global-poorest-20-is-deeper-in-ldcs\">their poverty tends to be deeper</a>.</p>\n<h4>ODA to LDCs has increased in the last decade, but is projected to fall</h4>\n<p>Aid to LDCs has increased in recent years, reaching a high of US$48\u00a0billion in 2013. While ODA overall has almost doubled since 2000, the share of aid to LDCs increased from 28% to 31% in 2013.(1)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/fig-1-ODA-to-LDCs-trends.png\"><img alt=\"fig 1 ODA to LDCs trends\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8660\" height=\"629\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/fig-1-ODA-to-LDCs-trends.png\" width=\"1202\"/></a></p>\n<p>However, preliminary Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) data for 2014 suggests that aid levels may have fallen back since 2013.(2) Also, the limited information available on donors\u2019 forward spending plans suggests further falls in aid to LDCs.</p>\n<h4>LDCs\u2019 share of ODA</h4>\n<p>LDCs received 31% of total gross aid (\u2018gross\u2019 meaning aid that does not subtract from the total ODA that flows out as loan repayments) in 2013. But this figure includes aid that cannot be said to be allocated to a particular country. Some is allocated on a regional basis and some to support global public goods, such as research into communicable diseases that will benefit all countries \u2013 including LDCs. When we examine \u2018country-allocable\u2019 aid only, which excludes this broader category of aid, we find that 42% went to LDCs in 2013.</p>\n<h5>A quarter of gross aid does not go to countries, but LDCs get 42% of that which does</h5>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/fig-2-LDC-shares-of-population-poorest-20-ODA.png\"><img alt=\"fig 2 LDC shares of population, poorest 20 &amp; ODA\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8755\" height=\"752\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/fig-2-LDC-shares-of-population-poorest-20-ODA.png\" width=\"1032\"/></a></p>\n<h4>Two \u2018ODA-to-LDCs\u2019 targets</h4>\n<p>Various options have been proposed for increasing ODA to LDCs. This data blog looks at two:</p>\n<h4>0.15\u20130.20% of GNI</h4>\n<p>The established target, emerging from the 2011 <a href=\"http://unohrlls.org/UserFiles/File/IPoA.pdf\">Istanbul Programme of Action for LDCs</a>, is that OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) donors should provide 0.15\u20130.20% of their gross national income (GNI) as ODA to LDCs.</p>\n<p>Collectively DAC countries provided US$46 billion of net ODA to LDCs in 2013, around half of the US$91\u00a0billion needed to reach 0.20% of GNI. \u00a0This represented 0.10% of their overall national income in 2013, up from 0.06% in 2000. Performance among DAC donors varies, with three donors providing 0.30% or more of their GNI and seven less than 0.05%.</p>\n<h5>Six donors have reached the 0.20% target based on net ODA, nine have reached 0.15%</h5>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/fig-4-0.15-0.20-of-GNI-as-ODA-to-LDCs1.png\"><img alt=\"fig 4 0.15-0.20 of GNI as ODA to LDCs\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8664\" height=\"1129\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/fig-4-0.15-0.20-of-GNI-as-ODA-to-LDCs1.png\" width=\"974\"/></a></strong></p>\n<h4>50% of aid</h4>\n<p>In current UN Finance for Development negotiations LDCs and other stakeholders have been proposing that 50% of ODA should be allocated to LDCs. However, donor performance against this target would depend on whether total aid or \u2018country-allocated\u2019 aid was being measured.</p>\n<p>If we analyse country-allocated aid, some 10 donors meet the 50% target already, with another (Luxembourg) just below and five more donors above 40%. However, less than 30% of this type of aid from Spain, Greece and Slovenia goes to LDCs.(4) Meeting 50% of country-allocated ODA would mean a further US$5 billion would need to be provided, on top of the US$50 billion that went to LDCs in 2013.</p>\n<h5>For aid that goes only to countries, 10 donors meet the proposed 50% target</h5>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/fig-3-50-pc-of-gross-net-ODA-to-LDCs.png\"><img alt=\"fig 3 50 pc of gross &amp; net ODA to LDCs\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8662\" height=\"1121\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/fig-3-50-pc-of-gross-net-ODA-to-LDCs.png\" width=\"1474\"/></a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For more information see our briefing, <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/targeting-aid-to-reach-the-poorest-people-ldc-aid-trends-and-targets\"><em>Targeting aid to reach the poorest people: LDC aid trends and targets</em></a>.</p>\n</div><div class=\"row--cards\" ng-if=\"post.notes\">\n<div class=\"col-md-12 card m-b--2\">\n<div class=\"card__content bg--light\">\n<h3 class=\"h3\">Notes</h3>\n<div> <p>For historical data, LDC country classifications in place in each year have been used.

See our recent <a href=\"http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/crisisbriefing/nepal-earthquake-update\" target=\"_blank\">humanitarian funding analysis</a> for the Nepal earthquake crisis. <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/\">Development Initiative\u2019s</a> partner in Nepal through the <a href=\"http://opennepal.net/home\">Open Nepal</a> initiative, <a href=\"http://younginnovations.com.np/\">Young Innovations</a>, has set up a <a href=\"http://earthquake.opennepal.net/\">tool</a> for tracking national and international funding to the crisis and report that an additional US$50 million in funding has also been committed/pledged from national sources to date.</p>\n<p>Over the past couple of weeks since the first major earthquake struck, there has been mounting public demand, particularly in affected districts, for information on how funding \u2013 from both international and national sources \u2013 has been allocated, where it has be channelled and who has received it. See a recent <a href=\"http://opennepal.net/blog/transparency-information-about-earthquake-relief-funds-cornerstone-successful-relief-delivery\">blog</a> from Open Nepal\u2019s Pavitra Rana regarding public demand for better data on funding. The heightened level of accountability resulting from better information on funding would help to ensure that available humanitarian resources are allocated effectively, appropriately and in response to people\u2019s needs.</p>\n<p>Public calls for transparency of international and national funding to the crisis are particularly pertinent in the context of Nepal, given the ongoing recovery from a decade long insurgency. In this context, it is important that humanitarian aid reaches all those in need and in particular the most marginalised groups who are also likely to be most affected by the earthquake.</p>\n<p><strong>Meeting the demand for better data and traceability of funding to the Nepal crisis</strong></p>\n<p>The public desire for greater accountability through better data on funding highlights a need for improved local and international mechanisms to trace how and where funding has been allocated, from source to recipient. The current humanitarian situation in Nepal may also provide lessons for the improvement of traceability systems more generally.</p>\n<p>Currently, mechanisms for the traceability of humanitarian assistance are lacking at both national and international levels, representing a critical gap in data on humanitarian financing. UN OCHA\u2019s FTS is the most comprehensive source of available data on humanitarian funding and plays a critical role in tracking international spending in response to individual crises. However, the FTS was designed to track the progress of funding to specific appeals and is not intended to enable funds to be traced through the system once committed \u2013 it shows just the first-level funding recipients rather than the full spectrum of donor to recipient. This makes it impossible to measure what has reached communities and when.</p>\n<p>So how can this data gap be filled?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The multi-stakeholder International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) is one way in which better data and information on humanitarian assistance could be made publically available. Originally designed for development aid, IATI is currently being modified to capture humanitarian assistance. <strong>A humanitarian marker added to the IATI standard </strong>will pave the way for longer term traceability of humanitarian funds at national and international levels. With greater availability, accessibility and use of information such as this, humanitarian actors could coordinate more effectively and enable accountability over the days, weeks, months and years following a disaster. However, although initial discussions around this are in place, the uptake of an IATI humanitarian marker into donor reporting systems will take time.</li>\n<li><strong>Local efforts to trace money are a very important contribution to transparency</strong>. The <a href=\"http://earthquake.opennepal.net/\">portal</a> developed by Young Innovations to track funding could be expanded to report on the amount of pledged funds actually committed and information crowd-sourced on how the funds have been spent. Other important local traceability efforts from those within Nepal\u2019s growing open development community include plans to work with clusters of donors in affected districts, plans to track government disbursements through right-to-information procedures, and plans to gather citizen-generated feedback from local volunteers to ensure accountability of relief expenditure.</li>\n<li>The Government of Nepal is reportedly coordinating the response through the Nepal Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC). <strong>The traceability of funding through the recently established Prime Minister\u2019s Relief Fund is going to be equally important in terms of accountability and meeting the information demands of affected communities</strong>. The government has stated that the details of receipts and expenditures of the Prime Minister\u2019s Disaster Relief Fund will be circulated on a daily basis, and that the fund will be audited annually by the Office of the Auditor General of Nepal. While this is important, and a positive step, annual efforts to audit accounts may not be enough to ensure effective traceability of humanitarian assistance. This raises a challenge for local and international actors to collaborate in joining up reporting systems in appropriate formats to ensure all stakeholders have access to information on how much has been given, where it has gone, how it got there, what it was spent on, and how quickly it was spent.</li>\n<li>Given that some development funds are likely to be channelled to address the longer-term effects of the earthquake \u2013 for example through reconstruction, rehabilitation, and disaster prevention and preparedness efforts \u2013 it is critical that all <strong>development actors involved in the response (both funders and recipient organisations) report to IATI</strong>. At present, the lack of real-time reporting of these funds (e.g. through the OECD creditor reporting system) prevents useful analysis of such funding, but reporting of development assistance through the IATI standard allows some potential.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Lessons for global discussions on the need for greater transparency and data on financing in crisis-affected countries</strong></p>\n<p>Lessons drawn from the experience of Nepal following the earthquakes on the need for better traceability of funds are relevant to broader global policy discussions currently taking place on effective financing and reporting in crisis-affected countries. These include discussions through the <a href=\"http://www.worldhumanitariansummit.org/\">World Humanitarian Summit (WHS),</a> Financing for Development (FfD), the UN High Level Panel on humanitarian financing, the Inter-Agency Standing Committee Task Team on humanitarian financing and the Future Humanitarian Financing Initiative (FHF). It is important that in these fora, further commitments are made to improve the traceability of humanitarian and development financing.</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Burundi at a crossroads", "author": ["Jason Braganza"], "format": "Data blog", "date": "30 Apr 2015", "description": "Protestors see the President\u2019s decision as unconstitutional because the presidential office is limited to two terms.

The protests and ensuing violence is threatening to regress this tiny landlocked country to the civil war that was witnessed in the 1990s.</p>\n<h3>What has been achieved since 2000?</h3>\n<p>Over the past 15 years, the Republic of Burundi has successfully stabilised following a series of civil conflicts between 1993 and 2000. This stability has brought significant national, regional and international benefits.</p>\n<p>At the <strong>national level</strong>, Burundi has experienced stable positive economic growth since 2000. GDP has risen from -1% in 2000 to 4.7% in 2014 and is expected to continue this upward trend, growing to 5.5% by 2020 (see figure below). For a tiny landlocked country like Burundi, this is a major achievement following a sustained period of peacetime. Linked to the positive GDP growth, resources for pro-poor sectors like education and health have also seen a steady upward trend. Government spending on education increased from 13% in 2000 to 16% in 2012 (as a percentage of total expenditure), while spending on health doubled from 7% to 14% over the same period. For a recovering fragile state, these are remarkable achievements.</p>\n<h5>Burundi\u2019s rising GDP is converging with the EAC region\u2019s average</h5>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Burundi-at-a-crossroads-1.jpg\"><img alt=\"Burundi at a crossroads 1\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-8532\" height=\"313\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Burundi-at-a-crossroads-1.jpg\" width=\"631\"/></a></p>\n<p>On the <strong>regional front</strong>, the Republic of Burundi joined the <a href=\"http://www.eac.int\">East African Community (EAC)</a> in 2006 enabling access to regional markets and trade routes to the Indian Ocean, as well as increased labour opportunities. Burundi\u2019s membership of the EAC has been a major factor in further stabilising the country and providing an outlet to regional and global markets. The country\u2019s economic performance is also gradually converging with the region\u2019s average GDP growth (see figure above).</p>\n<p>At the <strong>international level</strong>, the return to peace and stability in Burundi has allowed it to be a more active player on the global economic and political stages. Foreign direct investment has fluctuated since 2000 but experienced a general upward trend increasing from US$ 0.5 million in 2004 to US$ 6.5 million in 2013(1); an indication of confidence by investors. Perhaps more importantly, official development assistance (ODA) to Burundi has increased nearly threefold, in support of reconstruction efforts, from US$157 million in 2000 to US$ 546 million in 2013.

The Republic of Burundi is the fifth poorest country in the world, and the poorest country in the East African Community. It received a tiny proportion of aid (and also has a very weak domestic resources base). Hence it lags behind its EAC counterparts in all human and social indicators. Education and health per capita spending is the lowest in the region. The latest data shows out of 9.5 million Burundians, 81% or approx 7 million live below the $1.25-a-day poverty line. Furthermore, a deeper look at the poverty situation in the country reveals that those who are impacted by multidimensional aspects of poverty stand at 80% of the population (see table below). Of the poor people in Burundi, 14% are classified as being vulnerable to intense poverty and deprivation. It is therefore not surprising a significant proportion of the Burundian population stand to be made worse off should the current crisis deteriorate any further.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Burundi-at-a-crossroads-3.jpg\"><img alt=\"Burundi at a crossroads 3\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-8526\" height=\"449\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Burundi-at-a-crossroads-3.jpg\" width=\"976\"/></a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Republic of Burundi and the people of Burundi find themselves at a crossroads in 2015.

Government representatives from over 100 countries will gather with DRR experts and practitioners, to discuss the future of DRR. The conference is the culmination of months of discussions and negotiations in drafting a new international framework for DRR to succeed the 2005 <a href=\"http://www.unisdr.org/files/1037_hyogoframeworkforactionenglish.pdf\">Hyogo Framework for Action</a> (HFA). It also marks the beginning of an 18-month period of global processes relevant to poverty, vulnerability, crisis and risk including the International Conference on Financing for Development in Addis Ababa (July 2015), the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda in New York (September 2015), the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris (December 2015) and the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul (May 2016).</p>\n<p><strong>The case for investing in DRR</strong></p>\n<p>Last week in the build up to Sendai, the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction (<a href=\"http://www.unisdr.org/\">UNISDR</a>) launched the 2015 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction (GAR 2015). The GAR 2015 provides a comprehensive review of current and projected trends in global risk. The report provides compelling evidence of the need to invest in reducing risk to minimise spending on dealing with disasters. Some of the key findings include:</p>\n<p>1. \u00a0The poorest and most vulnerable people have the highest exposure to disasters</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <a href=\"http://www.preventionweb.net/english/hyogo/gar/2015/en/bgdocs/Noy,%202014.pdf\">new metric</a>\u00a0developed for the report calculates that 42 million life years were lost annually in internationally reported disasters between 1980 and 2012. Low and middle-income countries account for over 80% of total life years lost. <strong>These same groups of countries accounted for 88% of humanitarian assistance in 2012 and 84% between 2003 and 2012.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Investments in DRR make economic sense</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>GAR 2015 finds that governments need to set aside US$314 billion every year to meet annual average losses from earthquakes, tsunamis, tropical cyclones and flooding alone.</li>\n<li>GAR 2015 forecasts that an investment of US$6 billion annually in disaster risk management would result in avoided losses of US$360 billion over the next 15 years.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The case for investment in DRR is clear. Alongside the potential savings DRR investments can realise, there are recent examples where a significant allocation of resources has directly reduced the impact of large-scale natural hazard events. In the <a href=\"http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/report/gha-report-2014\">2014 GHA Report</a>, we highlighted how DRR investments from the Indian government and local authorities in the Adhra Pradesh and Odisha regions greatly reduced the number of fatalities caused by Cylone Phailin in 2013, compared with a similar intensity cyclone, Cyclone Orrisa in 1999.</p>\n<p><strong>Are investments in DRR materialising?</strong></p>\n<p>While investment in DRR has been emphasised since the adoption of the HFA in 2005 and increasingly in the build up to Sendai, concrete discussions around financing have so far been limited. Governments have the primary responsibility for spending on DRR, yet there are only a few examples of countries where DRR financing has been clearly identified in national budgets (see <a href=\"http://www.preventionweb.net/files/globalplatform/51967c57c3c9fMarc_Gordon,_2013.pdf\">UNISDR 2013</a>).This is not surprising as countries with fewer national resources are disproportionately impacted by disasters. These are countries where international spending on DRR is needed and of greater significance.</p>\n<p>Current estimates suggest while there has been a slight increase in DRR spending within international development assistance, it remains a very small proportion of total expenditure, just 0.4% of the total amount spent on international aid between 1991 and 2010 (<a href=\"http://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/8574.pdf\">ODI 2013</a>): 0.7% of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC) development assistance in 2011 (<a href=\"http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/report/gha-report-2013\">GHA 2013</a>). In terms of dealing with disasters and humanitarian emergencies, a minimal proportion (5.4% in 2013) of international humanitarian assistance can be identified as having been spent on disaster prevention and preparedness since the HFA was launched.</p>\n<p>It is likely that the actual figures are higher as humanitarian activities that contribute to reducing risk might be embedded in other programmes and so reported as such. It\u2019s also widely acknowledged that the existing data on international aid are not yet adequate to enable systematic tracking of DRR investments within development assistance (including humanitarian) expenditure. Improvements in the data on DRR financing are needed to better understand where and how investments are being made. Better data will help to identify gaps in spending and the extent to which DRR is being adequately mainstreamed within all development sectors.</p>\n<p><strong>Figure 1: Disaster prevention and preparedness funding from OECD DAC donors, 2005-2013</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Disaster-prevention-and-preparedness-funding-from-OECD-DAC-donors-2005-2013.jpg\"><img alt=\"Disaster prevention and preparedness funding from OECD DAC donors, 2005-2013\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6260\" height=\"266\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Disaster-prevention-and-preparedness-funding-from-OECD-DAC-donors-2005-2013-444x266.jpg\" width=\"444\"/></a></p>\n<p>Source: OECD DAC CRS \u2013 downloaded 10/03/2015</p>\n<p><strong>How can international DRR finances be better tracked?</strong></p>\n<p>In the current statistics on official development assistance (ODA), there are challenges in tracking investments for cross-sector policy objectives like DRR. In the OECD DAC Creditor Reporting System (CRS) \u2019markers\u2019 have been introduced to track cross-sector policy objectives such as gender and climate change adaptation.</p>\n<p>A marker for disaster risk management is under consideration by the DAC Working Party on Development Finance Statistics at the OECD, as a way of improving visibility of spending on risk management (including DRR). It is hoped that the presence of the marker will encourage the mainstreaming of disaster risk management into development planning, as it will require the review of every aid activity through a \u201c<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/officialdocuments/publicdisplaydocumentpdf/?cote=DCD/DAC/STAT%282014%293&amp;docLanguage=En\">disaster risk management lens</a></span>\u201d. This is an important and welcome step forward in DRR data and provides the tool to improve the visibility of where DRR is mainstreamed within development programmes. However, it is not the panacea for tracking DRR financing. Firstly, DAC donors are only one set of donors within the international financing picture \u2013 so the marker won\u2019t apply to those outside this group (other bilateral donors, regional bodies and private donors), although it could perhaps be a useful model for them. Secondly, visibility of mainstreaming masks big differences in the type and extent of investment in DRR in a given programme and is a long way from being able to quantify exactly how much is being spent on DRR. There have also been issues where limited reporting has undermined the value of some existing markers, such as the gender marker (<a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/gender-relevance-known-half-aid-2012\">Development Initiatives, 2014</a> and <a href=\"http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/reporting-gender-emergencies-decline-can-world-humanitarian-summit-help-address-6244.html\">GHA 2015</a>).</p>\n<p><strong>What about DRR funding at the national level?</strong></p>\n<p>Identifying DRR financing in national budgets is at least as challenging. Many countries operate traditional budget systems that focus on financial compliance and are typically not geared to enhancing policy clarity or effectiveness (<a href=\"http://www.odi.org/events/3701-international-handbook-public-financial-management-pfm\">International handbook of public financial management</a>, 2013). As with international expenditure, the cross-ministry/sector nature of DRR means it is often embedded in other activities and cannot be easily identified.</p>\n<p>There have been recommendations to include DRR budget codes within national budgets (see <a href=\"http://www.preventionweb.net/english/hyogo/gar/2013/en/bgdocs/Darwanto,%202012.pdf\">Darwanto 2012</a>). Such codes indicate whether a budgeted activity has a DRR purpose or focus and would be used across all ministries and agencies. Useful lessons can be drawn from other cross-sector policy objectives included in national budgets. The Nepalese government through the Ministry of Finance and National Planning Commission have introduced a <a href=\"http://www.unpei.org/latest-news/nepal-allocates-1034-of-its-2013-2014-budget-for-climate-funding\">climate budget code</a> to allow for tracking of climate expenditure. The initiative has led to an allocation of 10.3% of Nepal\u2019s 2013/2014 national budget to climate funding.</p>\n<p><strong>Discussions on financing in Sendai</strong></p>\n<p>While Sendai is first and foremost a forum for agreeing a future framework for DDR rather than mobilising funding, the importance of investments from national, international and private sector resources are likely to feature throughout. International development financing is only one of these potential resource flows for DRR and needs to be considered in the context of all resources to complement national initiatives and budgeting.</p>\n<p>More financing is undoubtedly needed, but needs to come hand in hand with better data to understand how much is actually given, from whom, to whom and for what. Sendai offers an opportunity for commitments to this at the national and international levels \u2013 based on the understanding that better data can drive better spending decisions, and ultimately the reduction of risk for those most vulnerable to disasters.</p>\n<p><strong>Further recommended reading on DRR financing</strong></p>\n<p>GHA (2012) <a href=\"http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/report/disaster-risk-reduction-spending-where-it-should-count\">Disaster Risk Reduction: Spending where it should count</a></p>\n<p>GHA (2012) <a href=\"http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/report/aid-investments-in-disaster-risk-reduction-rhetoric-to-action\">Aid investments in DRR: rhetoric to action</a></p>\n<p>ODI (2013) <a href=\"http://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/8574.pdf\">Financing DRR: A 20 year story of international aid</a></p>\n<p>ODI (2015) <a href=\"http://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/9473.pdf\">Briefing: Finance for disaster risk Reduction</a></p>\n<p>ODI and UNDP (2015) <a href=\"http://www.odi.org/publications/9334-10-things-know-about-finance-reducing-disaster-risk\">10 things to know about finance for reducing disaster risk</a></p>\n<p>UNISDR (2013) <a href=\"http://www.preventionweb.net/files/globalplatform/51967c57c3c9fMarc_Gordon,_2013.pdf\">Exploring Existing Methodologies for Allocating and Tracking Disaster Risk Reduction in National Public Investment</a></p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Reporting on gender in emergencies is in decline ...", "author": [], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "10 Mar 2015", "description": "On March 11, a workshop will be convened under the auspices of the UN Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) that will bring together humanitarian policy-", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/reporting-gender-emergencies-decline-can-world-humanitarian-summit-help-address/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>On March 11, a workshop will be convened under the auspices of the UN Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) that will bring together humanitarian policy-makers with women civil society leaders to discuss and identify policy recommendations on gender for the World Humanitarian Summit (WHS).<br/>\nThis initiative marks an important step towards strengthening the consideration of gender within the WHS. The issue of humanitarian financing is present in nearly all discussions around the WHS, and this workshop will be no exception. The Global Humanitarian Assistance (GHA) programme is actively working with the WHS humanitarian effectiveness thematic experts group to look at humanitarian financing across the discussions. For gender programming, as for all other areas of humanitarian response, for better and more accountable financing there needs to be strengthened reporting on what is being spent in this area.<br/>\nHowever, as illustrated in the below chart, donor reporting on funding to gender in emergencies, using the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) gender marker is currently poor, and declining.<br/>\n<strong><br/>\nChart 1: Humanitarian funding as per IASC gender marker, 2011\u20132014</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Chart-1.png\"><img alt=\"Humanitarian funding as per IASC gender marker, 2011\u20132014\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6245 size-full\" height=\"517\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Chart-1.png\" width=\"607\"/><br/>\n</a><em>Source: Development Initiatives taken from UN Office for the Coordination of Human Affair (OCHA)\u2019s Financial Tracking Service (FTS).</em></p>\n<p>As illustrated, the proportion of projects that are \u2018uncoded\u2019 (i.e. not coded using the IASC gender marker) has increased significantly from 57% in 2012 to 68% in 2014. This means that less than a third of all projects reported to the FTS in 2014 were coded using a gender marker.</p>\n<p>This increase in uncoded projects may in part account for the decline in the combined proportion of projects coded as making a \u2018significant\u2019 or \u2018principal\u2019 contribution to gender equality, which fell from 35% in 2012 to only 19% in 2014. This means that less than a fifth of all projects reported to the FTS in 2014 explicitly focussed on gender.</p>\n<p>To address this widening gap in reporting on gender there is a need for a standardised and systematic international approach to donor reporting on gender as an outcome of the WHS consultations.</p>\n<p>The closest we currently have to this is the IASC gender marker. There are some shortcomings with this marker as identified in a recent review \u2013 particularly regarding the need to extend the IASC gender marker from being a proposal development tool to being a programme cycle tool. However, reviewers said that it does provide a useful and standardised tool for tracking and comparing donor funding to gender in emergencies, which can be used as a starting point and improved over time.</p>\n<p>A mandatory commitment from all donors to use this marker when reporting on humanitarian spending to the UN OCHA\u2019s Financial Tracking Service (FTS) \u2013 for UN appeals and more widely \u2013 would help to fill this gap in information.</p>\n<p>There will of course be some technical challenges regarding the use of the marker, but these can be overcome with sufficient planning and support. As some Humanitarian Country Teams move towards activity-based (rather than project) costing in their SRPs, they will need to work with UN OCHA to understand what this means for using the gender marker and ensure that granular reporting is not lost.<br/>\nTo ensure consistency between donors in reporting, it is also important that internal systems used by donors to report spending on gender are compatible with standardised international reporting mechanisms on gender (i.e. the IASC gender marker), so that information contained in these internal systems can be easily transferred to international reporting systems (i.e. the FTS).</p>\n<p>As an example, the European Commission\u2019s Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection (ECHO) department\u2019s new \u2018Age-Gender Marker\u2019 (2013) seeks to achieve this and has been designed to be largely consistent with IASC gender marker by using a similar coding system. In addition, it is applied throughout the programme cycle, which is important in terms of tracking how funding to gender is actually allocated in practice (as opposed to how it was forecasted during the design phase). As such, ECHO\u2019s marker offers promising potential in terms of generating key lessons for other donors regarding the application of a gender marker as a programming and reporting tool, and building consistency with international reporting systems on gender.</p>\n<p>The WHS presents a critical opportunity to make a difference in humanitarian response to the different needs of women, men, girls and boys in crises, and to strengthen accountability on this issue. This must be accompanied by a stronger commitment from donors regarding their consistent use of an international standardised reporting system on gender.</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Ukraine is humanitarian priority for Central and E...", "author": ["Luminita Tuchel"], "format": "Data blog", "date": "09 Mar 2015", "description": "Four Central and Eastern European donors have committed their highest share of humanitarian assistance over 2014 and 2015 to Ukraine.

With this in mind, if we really want to empower citizens on the ground, we need to increase their access to data that is <strong>contextual, localized and connected </strong>to their daily lives. What we need is not just a centralised open data portal with massive datasets but an open data movement that is rooted in local context, satisfies the <strong>data need of local communities</strong> and facilitates engagement with the local government.</p>\n<h3>Kathmandu Ward #7 <a href=\"http://www.model4g.net\">Transparency and Participation Forum</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.yipl.com.np\">YoungInnovations</a> (representing <a href=\"http://www.opennepal.net\">Open Nepal</a>), <a href=\"http://www.kathmandulivinglabs.org/\">Kathmandu Living Labs</a>, <a href=\"http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/\">Kathmandu Metropolitan City Office</a> and Office of Member of Parliament Gagan Kumar Thapa have jointly launched <a href=\"http://www.model4g.net\"><strong>Transparency and Participation Forum</strong></a>. This is a pilot community open data forum for Kathmandu\u2019s Ward #7, launched on 21 February 2015 as part of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZSviwtWBDU\">Open Data Day celebrations in Kathmandu</a>. As the name suggests, it is more than just an open data portal, it is a forum to promote <strong>transparency of local government and facilitate civic participation</strong>. DI provided funding towards the development of this forum, as part of its InfoTEP programme.</p>\n<h3>Providing citizens with relevant government information</h3>\n<p>The core concept of this initiative is to provide local residents of Kathmandu Ward#7 with data and information about local government activities, resources and services in a single platform and encourage citizens to use them. It is a combination of both <strong>online and off-line interventions</strong>. Working with the local government, we have made available on the website relevant datasets that were demanded by the community (infrastructure development, revenue and taxes, expenditures, point of interests, etc.) and information (procedural information on services provided by ward offices, information about local government policies, etc) (<a href=\"http://www.model4g.net\">www.model4g.net</a>).</p>\n<h3>How citizens use the data and information</h3>\n<p>The data and information are accessible in <strong>open formats and under open licenses</strong> and are used by citizens for various purposes. Often, they are used by citizen groups \u2013 such as local youth clubs, student groups \u2013 during their community meetings and social gatherings to validate their argument or get more in-depth insights into the issues that matters to their community. These community groups will then be in a position to provide c<strong>onstructive feedback to the local government</strong>. The website itself facilitates civic participation where citizens can raise their voices through dedicated mobile apps, mailing lists and interactive voice response technologies.</p>\n<h3>A unique initiative</h3>\n<p>A number of aspects make the initiative \u00a0unique and contextual.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, it is a unique <strong>collaboration</strong> between the open data and mapping community, local government, citizen groups and policy makers.</li>\n<li>Second, it is about the <strong>process </strong>\u2013 the process of learning, creating value and ownership at the local level from a community angle rather than from a pure open data angle.</li>\n<li>Third, it is about <strong>building capacities</strong> of both local government and citizen groups so that both demand and supply side internalise the value that open data brings to them.</li>\n<li>Fourth, it is<strong> local \u2013 </strong>local language, local problem, local context, local solution and local partnership.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Based on the preliminary success, we are adopting a two-prong strategy to take the initiative further. First, it is <strong>going deep into the existing pilot at Kathmandu Ward #7</strong> and establishing a mechanism to sustain supply and demand of data working together with local government and citizen groups. Second, it is about<strong> replication and scale-up</strong> of the pilot in other areas as requested by other local governments, member of parliaments and communities.</p>\n<p>For a country like Nepal where open data is still not in the mainstream, this initiative is expected to lay a solid foundation for larger open data movements and prove that open data can generate impact!</p>\n<h3>About</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://opennepal.net/\">Open Nepal</a>\u00a0is a coalition of Nepali organisations, currently including Freedom Forum, YoungInnovations and NGO Federation of Nepal.

As of 19 January 2015, the SRP had received US$788 million, with UN agencies predominating as first-level recipients having received US$661 million, or 84% of funding.

In 2012, NGOs were the second largest first-level recipients of humanitarian assistance, directly receiving 19%. In the same year, nearly two-thirds (61%) of international humanitarian assistance went to multilateral organisations (primarily UN agencies). However, US$500 million of the total US$788 million donated by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) was given entirely to UN agencies.

While comparing funding flows with cases is useful, the large proportion of unearmarked funding recorded as regional makes it hard to reach firm conclusions.</p>\n<p>In October, the month after Liberia received the largest proportion of funding (54%), the number of monthly cases in the country peaked at 2,829. Since then, the rate of new reported cases in Liberia has declined, along with funding specifically earmarked for Liberia, which fell to 16% in December 2014 with no new funding allocated in 2015.</p>\n<p>The funding response targeting Sierra Leone was built up more slowly, eventually peaking in November 2014. Although Sierra Leone received 43% of total funding to the most severely affected countries that month, this was still less than half of the amount Liberia received at its peak \u2013 US$205 million compared with US$413 million. The number of new cases in Sierra Leone has consistently remained above 2,300 per month since October. Sierra Leone has also reported the highest number of overall cases at 10,094, almost half (48%) of all cases across the three countries, but it only received 20% of total funding directly.</p>\n<p>Critically, for every month recorded, a significant proportion of funding is unearmarked \u2013 that is, not allocated to a specific country in the region.

They provide analysis on humanitarian funding data from 2003 to 2012 (including 2013 where data is available). Importantly in the context of risk, resilience and poverty, they also contextualise humanitarian assistance within wider official development assistance. As a new feature to all 69 profiles, there is a summary of key facts giving a quick overview of financing trends, donor policies and recipient vulnerability indicators.</p>\n<p>The country profiles provide insight into the individual donor behaviour behind the overall global trend of increased humanitarian assistance (as reported in our <em><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/GHA-Report-2014-interactive.pdf\">GHA Report 2014</a></em>). Kuwait\u2019s profile in particular highlights the growth in funding from countries outside the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC), showing an increase in its humanitarian assistance by 2,315%, from US$14 million in 2012 to US$327\u00a0million in 2013. Our new profiles for OECD DAC donors Luxembourg and Italy, however, illustrate that this was not the case for every donor; both marginally decreased their contributions by US$1\u00a0million and US$7\u00a0million, respectively. Australia reduced its humanitarian expenditure by the largest percentage of the OECD DAC donors in 2013, with a 21% decrease.</p>\n<p>From the recipient perspective, the country profiles provide funding background to the current high-profile UN-coordinated humanitarian appeals, including appeals for Level 3 emergencies in <a href=\"http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/countryprofile/syria\">Syria</a>, <a href=\"http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/countryprofile/central-african-republic\">Central African Republic</a> (CAR) and the <a href=\"http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/countryprofile/philippines\">Philippines</a> in 2013. As a result of the prolonged crisis in Syria, its humanitarian assistance peaked at US$1.5 billion in 2012, making Syria the largest recipient that year. Initial estimates of Syria\u2019s humanitarian assistance in 2013 total US$1.4 billion. At the other end of the funding spectrum, the crisis in <a href=\"https://docs.unocha.org/sites/dms/CAP/CAP_2013_CAR.pdf\">CAR</a> has been consistently classified as a \u2018forgotten crisis\u2019 by the European Commission\u2019s Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department (ECHO) Global Vulnerability and Crisis Assessment. The <a href=\"https://docs.unocha.org/sites/dms/CAP/CAP_2013_CAR.pdf\">CAR 2013 Appeal</a> was the most underfunded appeal among the three Level 3 emergencies that year. Despite a significant increase (142%) in the total humanitarian assistance received by CAR (US$69 million in 2012 to US$167 million in 2013), CAR\u2019s profile shows that only 53% of needs were met by international donors.</p>\n<p>Prior to the Ebola virus outbreak, <a href=\"http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/countryprofile/guinea\">Guinea</a>, <a href=\"http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/countryprofile/sierra-leone\">Sierra Leone</a> and <a href=\"http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/countryprofile/liberia\">Liberia</a> collectively received US$35\u00a0million in humanitarian assistance in 2013; the <a href=\"https://docs.unocha.org/sites/dms/CAP/Ebola_outbreak_Sep_2014.pdf\">UN Response Plan</a> is currently requesting US$1.5\u00a0billion to respond to the crisis, of which 77% had been covered by 9 January 2015.

Many big questions are being raised which challenge international policymakers and governments to think creatively on how we tackle some of the major challenges facing the world.</p>\n</div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p><strong>Paradigm shift towards ending poverty</strong></p>\n<p>My role in these discussions has been to try and provide some new thinking around two questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>How can ODA contribute to all aspects of a broader and more ambitious post-2015 development agenda</li>\n<li>What are the comparative advantages of ODA in the much broader agenda of a post-2015 development finance framework?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here at Development Initiatives, we start from the premise that eradicating poverty is of first importance. It\u2019s also important we remain aware what the new agenda is fundamentally trying to achieve \u2013 the big vision of the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which includes the goal to end poverty in all its forms and leave no one behind.</p>\n<p>A major shift in the global discussion means we are no longer talking about halving poverty but <a href=\"http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/owg.html\">\u2018ending poverty in all its forms, everywhere\u2019</a>. This vision will require development finance to <a href=\"http://devinit.org/global-context/\">address a broader range of challenges beyond 2015</a>.</p>\n<h3>What is the current picture on poverty?</h3>\n<p>Let me look firstly at poverty to better understand the scale of need which development financing is trying to address. Recent World Bank projections reveal without accelerated efforts, there could be more than <a href=\"http://devinit.org/world-bank-suggests-400m-people-extreme-poverty-2030/\">400 million people living on less than $1.25 a day by 2030</a>.</p>\n<p>In sharp contrast to the strides South Asia looks to make, sub-Saharan Africa is likely to still be home to over fourth-fifths (81%) of extremely poor people by 2030, despite making progress. Poverty in sub-Saharan Africa would fall by less than a fifth in 15 years to stand at 335 million by 2030. These projections show that achieving this ambitious goal is not a given unless we do things differently.</p>\n<p>Secondly, the context in which poverty is concentrated is also changing and will continue to change as we move toward 2030. In 1990 only 20% of the extreme poor were in fragile states. That has now increased to 50%. Further analysis by DI shows that 96% of people currently living in poverty are living in countries that are either politically fragile, environmentally vulnerable or both.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Blog_Future-of-ODA_fig-1.png\"><img alt=\"Blog_Future of ODA_fig 1\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4876\" height=\"537\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Blog_Future-of-ODA_fig-1.png\" width=\"919\"/></a></h3>\n<p>Therefore many people who live in extreme poverty live in complex situations and face overlapping vulnerabilities, and therefore addressing these wider issues will be fundamental if investments to end poverty are to have a sustainable outcome.</p>\n<p><strong>Can poverty needs be met by domestic resources?</strong></p>\n<p>So let\u2019s look at poverty in relation to domestic spending. DI\u2019s research in Investments to End Poverty has already highlighted <a href=\"http://devinit.org/report/investments-to-end-poverty/\">the importance of prioritising countries with high proportions of populations living in poverty and low domestic resources for public spending</a>. 83% of people living on less than $1.25 a day live in countries where government spending is less than $1,500 per person per year \u2013 just $4 a day. Let\u2019s put that in context \u2013 an average DAC country spends over PPP$17,000, so that is less than 10% of spending per person of DAC members.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Blog_Future-of-ODA_fig-2.png\"><img alt=\"Blog_Future of ODA_fig 2\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4879\" height=\"477\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Blog_Future-of-ODA_fig-2.png\" width=\"670\"/></a></p>\n<p>AND a third of the poorest people live in countries where government spending is even less \u2013\u00a0PPP$500. And it is these countries with the lowest domestic resources that will also experience the slowest growth in spending. Based on current projects, no country where government spending is less than $500 per person per year will reach $1000 by 2030.</p>\n<p>Therefore, these countries will face severe financial constraints in leading implementation of the post-2015 agenda at the domestic level.</p>\n<p><b>What does this mean for how we target resources?</b></p>\n<p>Addressing $1.25-a-day poverty is only the first step in ending poverty in all its forms. Given the scale, depth and complexity of poverty, leaving no one behind will require resources to be targeted differently \u2013\u00a0<a href=\"http://devinit.org/income-status-basis-aid-allocation-decisions/\">targeting people, rather than countries</a>\u00a0\u2013 to lift everyone sustainably out of poverty.</p>\n<p>The role of other international resources was highlighted in our <a href=\"http://devinit.org/report/investments-to-end-poverty/\">Investments to End Poverty</a> report as a critical part of the puzzle. However, we must look deeper and recognise many of these flows are currently concentrated in a few countries and also create outflows. For example, foreign direct investment is 3 times larger than ODA, but two-thirds of it goes to just 10 countries while half of all remittances go to just 5 countries.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Blog_Future-of-ODA_fig-3.png\"><img alt=\"Blog_Future of ODA_fig 3\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4877\" height=\"425\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Blog_Future-of-ODA_fig-3.png\" width=\"962\"/></a></p>\n<p>ODA is one of the main official flows that can be explicitly targeted at poverty reduction. While other resources are bound by the need to seek profit, avoid risky environments and flow to more economically developed countries, ODA has characteristics that make it well suited for social investments, and it already tends to flow to countries where there are large proportions of the population living in poverty. (For more on this, see <a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ODA-allocation-post-2015_One-pager-12-Nov.pdf\">DI\u2019s forthcoming report on ODA allocations</a>, which is being prepared for the 2016 UN Development Cooperation Forum).</p>\n<p>Even so, ODA could still be much more effective. Currently, as the below graph demonstrates, ODA per poor person is highest where the depth of poverty is lowest. In countries where average incomes of the poor are far below the poverty line, we can see that ODA per poor person is also lower in these countries.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Blog_Future-of-ODA_fig-ODA-per-poor-person.png\"><img alt=\"Blog_Future of ODA_fig ODA per poor person\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4899\" height=\"492\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Blog_Future-of-ODA_fig-ODA-per-poor-person.png\" width=\"726\"/></a></p>\n<p>Recent research by DI has found that agencies providing ODA who have a specific mandate to end poverty as part of their objective do target their ODA to the poorest countries with 80% of their ODA going to countries with high rates of poverty. In comparison, agencies where poverty reduction is not a specific goal, only allocated around a third of their ODA to countries where poverty levels are high, instead favouring emerging economies with less poverty.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Blog_Future-of-ODA_fig-ODA-allocations-from-agencies.png\"><img alt=\"Blog_Future of ODA_fig ODA allocations from agencies\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4908\" height=\"527\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Blog_Future-of-ODA_fig-ODA-allocations-from-agencies.png\" width=\"938\"/></a></p>\n<p>In a world of increasing inequality and within a framework of leaving no-one behind, we should target people not countries if we are going to end poverty in all its forms everywhere. Currently, the purpose of ODA is \u2018economic welfare and development\u2019. In a world where many other flows can be used for this purpose, it makes sense to reevaluate what ODA is used for and where it can have most impact within the broader post-2015 framework. Poverty eradication is a purpose well suited to ODA.</p>\n<p>All development finance must evolve if it is to effectively support a more ambitious and holistic post-2015 agenda. Within a broadened agenda there\u2019s an acute need to focus the purpose of ODA to targeting the poorest people, complimented by a measure by which we can assess the extent to which the poorest have benefited from any investment.</p>\n<p>Alongside a refined and more targeted purpose for ODA, targeting the poorest 20% of people living in poverty will mean driving investments across all three pillars of development \u2013 economic, social and environmental. ODA can enhance the effectiveness of spending alongside other types of investments by focusing on having an impact on the poorest people. This is essential if gains made in eliminating poverty are to be sustained over the long term.</p>\n<h4><strong>\u00a0<a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ODA-allocation-post-2015_One-pager-12-Nov.pdf\">Read more about our forthcoming report in collaboration with UN DCF</a></strong></h4>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Understanding the role of \u2018Zakat\u2019 in humanitar...", "author": [], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "23 May 2014", "description": "This is a guest blog by Amjad Mohamed Saleem. \u2018Zakat\u2019 is the Muslim practice of charitable giving based on accumulated wealth.

Dr Jemilah Mahmood and Amjad Mohamed Saleem explore this issue further.\u00a0</em></p>\n<h3>Understanding charity and Zakat in Islam</h3>\n<p>The recent report by the Global Humanitarian Assistance (GHA) Programme: <a href=\"http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/report/humanitarian-assistance-non-state-donors\"><i>Humanitarian Assistance from Non-State Actors: What is it Worth</i>?</a> makes interesting and pertinent reading, pointing to a paradigm shift in thinking around both humanitarian funding and programme delivery as new non-state actors have emerged as key players alongside traditional institutional actors. Here we explore the potential role of \u2018Zakat\u2019 in humanitarian assistance as a significant form of non-state humanitarian funding.</p>\n<p>The concept of charity is central to social justice, which is a sacred value in Islam and a tenet of the faith. Indeed the Qur\u2019an considers an act of charity as more than just a good deed because of its function in balancing social inequalities. The Qur\u2019an also has numerous references to the importance of creating a just society and provides a framework for justice in inter-personal relationships toward the poor and needy, and connections between communities and nations.</p>\n<p>Muslim non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and other Islamic charitable institutions are therefore seen as instruments of <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CC4QFjAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.csidonline.org%2Fdocuments%2Fpdf%2F5th_Annual_Conference-Bremer_paper.pdf&amp;ei=2gNhU8egH8XmPPymgPgB&amp;usg=AFQjCNFn4xzKyroDQXiaYqIhNVOqDsnUOw&amp;bv\">social justice</a>, and are part of the theological, intellectual and cultural heritage of the Muslim society. The instruments are divinely entrenched in the teachings of Islam, as illustrated in the following verse from the Qur\u2019an: <i>\u00a0\u201cIf anyone saved a life it would be as if he had saved the life of the whole of mankind\u2026\u2019</i> (5:32). It is these types of teachings that have inspired acts of charity, concern for others and the provision of social welfare to be an integral role in Muslim societies for the last 1400 years, as without them <a href=\"http://www.cambridge.org/\">faith is incomplete</a>.</p>\n<p>Charity in Islam, in the traditional sense of a transfer of material resources from the rich to the poor, falls into two categories in Islam: voluntary (Sadaqah) and obligatory (Zakat). These practises are supposed to empower communities and address their needs sufficiently enough to lift them out of their vicious cycle of poverty.</p>\n<h3>Challenges faced in use of funds collected through the Zakat process</h3>\n<p>There is no shortage of funds for charitable causes coming from the Muslim world. The issue is not about the amount to be collected but what is done with it. <a href=\"http://www.irinnews.org/\">A study in 2012</a> has estimated that every year, somewhere between US$200 billion and US$1 trillion are spent in \u201cmandatory\u201d alms and voluntary charity across the Muslim world. In fact, <a href=\"http://www.irinnews.org/\">Islamic financial analysts estimate</a> that \u201cAt the low end of the estimate, this is 15 times more than global humanitarian aid contributions in 2011 of $13 billion (UN Financial Tracking System)\u201d. However, as economist <a href=\"http://www.irinnews.org/Report/95564/Analysis-A-faith-based-aid-revolution-in-the-Muslim-world\">Habib Ahmed calculated in 2004</a> \u2013 Muslim countries could lift all of their poor people out of poverty with only a third to a half of all potential Zakat collections.</p>\n<p>These numbers speak not only to the duality of increasing religiosity and wealth in the Muslim world, but also to the globalisation of increasing poverty. It is estimated that one-quarter of the Muslim world is living on less than $1.25 a day (calculated by <a href=\"http://www.irinnews.org/\">IRIN</a> based on 2011 Human Development Index) with increasing needs for humanitarian response, recovery and peace-building in the Muslim world from Somalia, Syria, Mali among many other countries.</p>\n<p>However in recent times, there has been a lack of understanding (and spirit) with regards Zakat<i> </i>(and Sadaqah). Zakat is largely regarded as charitable giving and its potential to go one step further and empower communities has not been adequately realised. As a result, the wide breadth of possibilities, which includes supporting non-Muslims; the levying of administration costs for the collection of Zakat; vital infrastructure projects; peace building and human trafficking initiatives remain grossly under funded and unexplored with Zakat.\u00a0 Herein lies the major challenge of balancing the role of Zakat in its conventional understanding with the contemporary demands of society today.</p>\n<h3>The way forward</h3>\n<p>If we are to move forward in terms of really contributing to humanitarian and development initiatives, we need to evaluate and understand the empowering concepts of Zakat in order to develop new models for implementation that are not only congruent with the times but address the empowering aspects of Zakat. At the end of the day, charity in Islam is about redistributive justice as the hoarding of wealth is not permissible and carries penalties if found guilty of such practice.</p>\n<p>Private donors \u2013 including Muslim NGOs and other Islamic charitable institutions involved in the allocation of funds collected through Zakat \u2013 need to move away from the idea that humanitarian response is merely an act of charity and philanthropy, but a tool for empowering communities to build resilience to poverty and humanitarian assistance.</p>\n<p><em>Blog image: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/33707373@N03/5926250678/in/photolist-5Qece-uwAyq-8TJDdH-49N7Bu-5u1tnp-9LxaJN-S6zt3-8TJSRZ-jMtqhe-a8N1b2-6T8Tma-3aXQqr-8TJSS8-a31oEu-8TJSSp-a2FzRQ-KPyAN-pb5z4-D1NtU-D1Nu1-8uFNJQ-5cUHnr-6jpRAm-7HWugT-5WWRsJ-D1Nu3-D1Nu4-7y6ZnF-D1NtX-D1NtP-5M4K3A-a8N2f2-rBhT-62hzdZ-3rE9g-fsS7a-62hz3c-5f9soN-89wwhy-d4abzd-5gr521-kAyhL9-gG9mDd-gG9Q1t-gG9mR7-5vajrK-4zqSe6-aLDbZi-5v5G2r-9tzroc\">Mohd Althani</a></em></p>\n<p>Amjad Mohamed Saleem is a political analyst on peacebuilding and humanitarian issues in South &amp; South East Asia, with a specific interest in the role of faith in conflict transformation.

However, there are challenges to establishing effective mechanisms to unleash its development potential. And unless public-private partnerships for development work to maintain the hard won principles of development aid, like transparency and accountability, the potentially positive impacts of private investments in sustainable development could be undermined.</p>\n<p>These are the findings of a major new report launched by the <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal/en\">European Parliament</a> this week, focusing on the role of multilateral institutions, development finance institutions (DFIs) and aid agencies in building public-private partnerships for development and examining the various policy options and mechanisms that are now being explored, in the context of post-2015 financing debates. *</p>\n<p>Below are some top line findings and messages from the report that especially resonated with us:</p>\n<p><b>Private finance is growing\u2026bringing new opportunities for developing countries</b><b>\u00a0</b></p>\n<p>In recent years we have seen a sea change in the general approach to the role of private finance in development circles. Recognition of the growth of private finance, such as foreign direct investment (FDI) has led many actors to expand blended mechanisms of financing and experiment with new models that look to unleash the development potential of these resources. As we move towards the establishment of an ambitious post-2015 agenda, this is important: realising the end of poverty will require partnerships and the alignment of actors from all sectors.</p>\n<p>The numbers on FDI underscore the necessity of considering the contribution of the private sector in any discussion about how to finance global development goals. Total investment in developing countries grew from 24% of GDP in 2000 to 32% in 2011. Private finance now accounts for the largest international flows to developing countries: FDI totalled US$472 billion in 2011, and loan disbursements almost US$700 billion. These are enormous numbers, especially in comparison to the amount of official development assistance (ODA) available.</p>\n<p><b>There are challenges to unleashing the potential of private finance for development</b><b>\u00a0</b></p>\n<p>There are two issues with the top-line FDI figures, once you look deeper. First, outflows<b> </b>of private finance from many developing countries are also extremely large. Often, they aren\u2019t productive investments in other countries but loan repayments, repatriated profits or illicit finance. FDI is an important example: the repatriated profits on FDI leaving developing countries were equivalent to almost 90% of new FDI in 2011.</p>\n<p>Second, some FDI \u2018inflows\u2019 are actually the reinvestment of profits earned within the country: i.e. not an inflow. This may be significant: reinvested earnings accounted for over 60% of \u2018outward\u2019 FDI from developed countries in 2012. The infographic below demonstrates <em>(click to enlarge).</em></p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" id=\"attachment_2889\" style=\"width: 829px\"><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/BloUsing-all-resources-available-to-end-poverty-fig-2.png\"><img alt=\"Using all resources available to end poverty fig 2\" class=\" wp-image-2889 \" height=\"399\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/BloUsing-all-resources-available-to-end-poverty-fig-2-1024x499.png\" width=\"819\"/></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A fluid mix of resources flows into and out of developing countries. Amounts in US$ billions, 2011</p></div>\n<p>Additionally, efforts to incentivise and mobilise private finance and channel it towards sustainable development objectives in practice have faced a number of challenges. For example, while most jobs in developing countries are created by MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises), the report finds that DFIs have struggled to design programmes that work for small enterprises on a large scale. There are important questions about what the involvement of public resources adds to private investments: development-effective mechanisms should stimulate investments that would not otherwise have been made (financial additionality), or influence the business model to follow a more development-friendly approach (operational additionality). Yet evidence as to whether this is actually happening is weak. Ownership over DFIs and their blended mechanisms by developing countries has also been found to be low.</p>\n<p>There is a tension between business confidentiality and adhering to the fundamental development principles (and commitments) of transparency and accountability. Standard practice for many institutions working with the private sector is to withhold information deemed commercially sensitive including, for example, impact evaluations. Many investments are made through financial intermediaries and little information is made available of how funds are spent through the chain.</p>\n<p><b>Transparency and accountability are essential in public-private partnerships for development</b></p>\n<p>It is vital that institutions which have committed to be transparent and accountable retain these values in partnerships with private finance. Transparency underpins a continued focus on development outcomes and pushes institutions to prove the impact of the models they are experimenting with. Ultimately, as we move towards a post-2015 agenda that will require partnerships between all actors, public and private, it helps us learn which models work best.</p>\n<p>Both public and private resources will have a vital role to play in realising the post-2015 vision. It is important that we recognise the roles of different types of finance, their different strengths and what each type of finance can best contribute to financing development and the end of poverty. Only through fully understanding these challenges, and working transparently, can we find mechanisms that can be truly transformative.</p>\n<p>*<i>Full disclosure \u2013 I was one of the co-authors of the report, along with <i>Javier Pereira and\u00a0</i>Jesse Griffiths at <a href=\"http://www.eurodad.org/\">Eurodad</a>\u00a0and\u00a0Matthew Martin at <a href=\"http://www.development-finance.org/\">DFI</a>.</i></p>\n<p><i>Full report:\u00a0<a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Financing-for-development-Final-report.pdf\">European Parliament: Financing for Development in Post-2015</a>.

Levels of international concern and generosity have been high.

Two weeks on, the <a href=\"http://fts.unocha.org/pageloader.aspx?page=emerg-emergencyCountryDetails&amp;cc=phl\">UN\u2019s\u00a0 Financial Tracking Service (FTS)</a> has so far reported that US$304m has been committed from sources ranging from donor governments to private individuals and a further US$270m pledged. The UN <a href=\"http://fts.unocha.org/pageloader.aspx?page=emerg-emergencyDetails&amp;appealID=1043\">launched an appeal</a> for US$301 million and this is now 43% funded at US$128.3.</p>\n<h3>How does the response so far compare with that to other large scale natural disasters?</h3>\n<p>The number of lives affected by these disasters is enormous and the impact on each person is devastating and often long term. \u00a0As well as those killed, the Pakistan floods\u00a0affected an estimated 20 million people, the Indian Ocean tsunami just over 2.3 million people, and the\u00a0Haiti earthquake 3.7 million. In comparison, the Philippines typhoon has affected an estimated 12.9 million people.</p>\n<p>Yet the reported financial response by day 14 of each crisis response is \u00a0not always proportionate to the respective size of the affected population.\u00a0 Over 5 times as many people were affected by typhoon Haiyan than by the 2004 Tsunami, yet\u00a0 more than 6 times less financial assistance has been given. \u00a0Comparison with the Pakistan floods however, shows a more similar level of response per affected person \u2013 approximately US$25 per person affected by the Pakistan floods and US$23.5 in the current Philippines emergency.</p>\n<h3>What does this tell us about the Haiyan response?</h3>\n<p>Certainly not that there\u2019s been a lack of generosity. \u00a0But the immediate conclusion might be that levels of funding are not dictated by relative numbers of people affected but by other factors. These could include media profile and global economic climate. Or perhaps perceptions of the severity of need, of the cost of responding in each of the contexts, or of the existing coping capacity.</p>\n<h3>Points to bear in mind when interpreting this chart</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>This data only represents the financial assistance reported to the FTS. Even when donors report their funding quickly, it can take a week for a commitment and to upload onto the FTS. And many private and government donors do not systematically report to the FTS, or report very late. So, retrospectively, the Philippines figures may look slightly different.</li>\n<li>\u00a0Of course, financial assistance is not the whole story \u2013 in kind assistance is not represented in the graph. Today the Philippines Government\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.gov.ph/faith/\">Foreign Aid Transparency Hub (FAiTH)</a> reported over US$239.4 million in non-financial assistance.\u00a0 At the same point in the response, around the same amount of in-kind assistance had been committed to both the tsunami (US$239m) and the Pakistan (US$239.6m) emergencies, while Haiti received $111.2m.</li>\n<li>And of course\u00a0 global government and private commitments are only part of the resources that affected people receive \u2013 what would this graph of humanitarian response look like if we added in the figures for domestic response (lower in Haiti, higher in Philippines?) and remittances (likely to be high for Philippines?).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We\u2019ll be looking into some of these issues in the coming weeks.

The title refers to <a href=\"http://www.chronicpovertynetwork.org\">what the authors see</a> as as a fundamental disconnect between the Ugandan chronically poor, and Ugandan policymakers; caused by a failure on the part of Ugandan leadership to include poor people in policymaking, as well as a failure to communicate effectively.</p>\n<p>A headline finding of the CPR is that economic growth will likely not be enough to eradicate the chronic poverty which persists in Uganda.

Growth-focused development strategies which are aimed at eradicating poverty, but which make no provision for those in chronic poverty (the elderly; the disabled; those in isolated rural areas with lack of access to opportunity, education and jobs; those vulnerable to climate change and disaster) could be counter-productive and remove the positive impacts of growth in the long term.

R</i><i>ead the <a href=\"http://devinit.org/report/investments-to-end-poverty/\">full report</a> (and complete methodology).</i></p>\n<h3><b>Is growth alone enough?</b></h3>\n<p>My starting point for the opening chapter of Investments to End Poverty was one question:\u00a0Can economic growth alone get the world to zero extreme poverty by 2030?*</p>\n<p>With good global economic headwinds, growth can be a rising tide that lifts all boats\u2026 eventually. Assuming reasonable growth rates continue \u2013 and no new global crises \u2013 poverty against a fixed threshold is quite likely to fall, and ultimately to zero. But to galvanise effort getting to zero demands a deadline. Development Initiatives has believed for some time that it is possible to end extreme poverty by 2030. Only recently has this become widely accepted: the UN\u2019s High-Level Panel report, being debated by world leaders this month, has proposed this as a global target.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/blog_chart_global_poverty1.png\"><img alt=\"blog_chart_global_poverty\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1601 alignright\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/blog_chart_global_poverty1-178x300.png\" width=\"178\"/></a></p>\n<p>Brookings Institution research \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/research/reports/2013/04/ending-extreme-poverty-chandy\">The Final Countdown</a>, well worth a read \u2013 shows that current economic growth patterns are clearly <b>not</b> enough to get us to zero by 2030. Even the best-case scenario \u2013 rapid growth, shared more equally with the poor \u2013 could see over 100 million people globally remaining in extreme poverty in 2030, almost all of them in sub-Saharan Africa. Should conditions worsen \u2013 slower growth, less equally shared \u2013 then over a billion people could be left behind. (You can explore this further in our <a href=\"http://devinit.org/data-visualization/datavisualization-poverty-map/\">data visualisation tool</a>).</p>\n<p>The finding that even optimistic growth patterns is not enough is critical. It means that further interventions are going to be needed in order for the world to get to zero by 2030. It suggests that, far from \u2018trade not aid\u2019, we will need both aid <b>and</b> trade\u2026 and also investment, remittances** and a range of other resource flows (as presented in our report).</p>\n<h3><b>Depth of poverty in Africa</b></h3>\n<p>Another key finding is the sheer divergence in the \u2018depth of poverty\u2019 in sub-Saharan Africa: average incomes of people in extreme poverty range from as low as $0.53 a day in DRC up to $1.10 a day in Cameroon.***</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/blog_chart_africa_poverty_depth.png\"><img alt=\"blog_chart_africa_poverty_depth\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1438 alignright\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/blog_chart_africa_poverty_depth-256x300.png\" width=\"256\"/></a></p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3><b>Data behind the scenarios</b></h3>\n<p>Working with Brookings we were able to base the Investments to End scenarios on an update of the data in their published report, including 40 recent country household surveys. Unfortunately, because of data quality issues we could only focus on seven countries in our report, although four were in sub-Saharan Africa.**** The Brookings research was based on World Bank <a href=\"http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/index.htm\">PovCalNet</a> \u2013 a fantastic resource for the surveys used to calculate poverty levels \u2013 and <a href=\"http://www.eiu.com/\">Economist Intelligence Unit</a> growth forecasts.</p>\n<h3><b>So what next?</b></h3>\n<p>This research cannot be a one-off. Economic conditions will change, and progress must be monitored and efforts re-focused accordingly to get to zero by 2030. Post-2015 we need a \u2018World Poverty Outlook\u2019: an annual or biannual globally and regional assessment, identifying risks to economic conditions which could undermine wider interventions to end poverty \u2013 and propose mitigations of those risks.</p>\n<p>With major improvements to poverty data that our report calls for, these assessments should look at prospects for individual countries. In future they should delve within countries \u2013 down to the district and village level. These are vital data for targeting pockets of extreme poverty that persist in all \u2013 even the fastest-growing \u2013 developing countries.</p>\n<h3><b>Notes</b></h3>\n<p>* The extreme poverty threshold is set at $1.25 a day in 2005 prices, and is based on exchange rates adjusted for differences in purchasing power in different countries. Often an amount of money can buy more in a developing country because costs and prices are lower. It can be thought of as the equivalent of how much $1.25 could buy in the US in 2005, rather than how much you could buy if you changed US dollars into local currencies and bought things with that money.</p>\n<p>** Remittances are monies sent back by migrants abroad to their families at home.</p>\n<p>*** These spending figures are adjusted for relative purchasing power, like the $1.25 poverty line.</p>\n<p>**** China, India and Indonesia; Burkina Faso, Malawi, Mali and Uganda in Africa.</p>\n<h3><b>Reference</b></h3>\n<p>Projections and average incomes of the extreme poor data use the methodology outlined in Chandy, Ledlie and Penciakova, <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/research/reports/2013/04/ending-extreme-poverty-chandy\">The Final Countdown: Prospects for Ending Extreme Poverty by 2030</a> (2013), applied to their dataset updated with 40 more recent country surveys.<b></b></p>\n<p><em>If you have thoughts or questions on the \u00a0methodology and research on ending poverty in Chapter 1, please do leave your comments below or catch up with the DI team on Twitter <a href=\"http://twitter.com/devinitorg\" target=\"_blank\">@devinitorg</a>.\u00a0</em></p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Humanitarian Accountability Report 2013 - How far ...", "author": [], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "04 Jul 2013", "description": "This week saw the release of the 10th annual edition of the\u00a0Humanitarian Accountability Partnership\u2019s (HAP)\u00a0Humanitarian Accountability Report.

The 2013 report reviews progress in making humanitarian assistance more accountable over the past decade, discusses some of the obstacles faced along the way, and presents innovations the sector has adopted in order to make itself more accountable to populations affected by crises. It also highlights the role of transparency in accountability, and considers the potential impact of technology.</p>\n<p>Transparency: A precondition to accountability?</p>\n<p><i>\u201cInternational agencies can give information to the people and tell the whole village so all the people will have the information about the projects and budget. When so many people know the project, no one can manipulate it or do corruption.

Our own\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/coming-soon-gha-report-2013-4126.html\">GHA report 2013</a>\u00a0calls for improvements in the reporting of data on humanitarian aid in order to enable more informed decision-making, improve efficiency and increase accountability.</p>\n<p>Technology: The \u201csilver bullet\u201d?</p>\n<p><i>\u201cTransparency and access to information is a hallmark of democratic societies. While aid organisations advocate for the very principles that underpin democracy, they often fail to be as transparent as the standards they promote\u2026 Technological progress has the potential to increase the accountability and transparency of humanitarian assistance in a crisis. However, these advances are not in themselves sufficient to alter the way aid organisations communicate with disaster-affected communities. For that to occur, organisational cultures and staff attitudes must also evolve.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Recent developments in technology have led to a host of innovative new ways of employing ICT in humanitarian response, and this has undoubtedly contributed to improving the flow of information to and amongst crisis-affected people in recent years. However, the HAP report warns that, whilst technological progress has the potential to increase accountability and transparency, it is not necessarily \u201cthe answer\u201d; organisations also need to improve their capacity to gather information \u2013 as well as their own information-sharing practices \u2013 and get better at integrating and tracking feedback from the communities they aim to help.</p>\n<p>What next?</p>\n<p>The report warns that, whilst collective understanding of what it takes to achieve real accountability has vastly improved in recent years, there is still plenty more to be done. Practice is not yet on a par with policy, and isolated examples of best practice in the field must be scaled up to become standard practice across the whole humanitarian system.</p>\n<p>This year\u2019s Humanitarian Accountability Report offers a comprehensive analysis of progress made over the last ten years in terms of accountability in the delivery of humanitarian assistance, and provides a snapshot of the state of accountability in the sector today. It reminds us that transparency is key to achieving accountability, and that \u201cbeing accountable to the people we aim to serve is not just the right thing to do, it is also the best way to ensure programmes are relevant, effective, efficient and sustainable.\u201d</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Top 100 Best NGOs ranking by The Global Journal", "author": [], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "27 Jan 2012", "description": "Earlier this week,\u00a0The Global Journal\u00a0\u2013 a Geneva-based magazine \u2013 published its inaugural annual\u00a0\u2018Top 100 Best NGOs\u2019 list.

While seismogenic tsunamis pose a demonstrable threat to Thailand, flooding is an annual occurrence and potentially the more significant hazard. Vulnerability to large-scale flooding is increasing as volumes of water from monsoon rains are becoming less predictable due to climate change, the impact of urbanisation and issues around land use practices (for more see <a href=\"http://floodcarethailand.blogspot.com/p/causes-of-flooding.html\">causes of flooding in Thailand</a>).

A Department for Disaster Prevention and Mitigation was created in 2002 to coordinate disaster management. The creation of the Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Act 2007 and the formulation of the National Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Plan 2010 \u2013 2014 should also be noted (for further details on national efforts see<a href=\"http://www.preventionweb.net/files/18764_tha_NationalHFAprogress_2009-11.pdf\">Thailand\u2019s national progress report on the implementation of the HFA 2009-2011</a>).</p>\n<p>When events of this scale occur, international aid will inevitably be given to even the wealthiest countries, as demonstrated by the fact that Japan received US$720 million in humanitarian aid (UNOCHA FTS) following the catastrophic tsunami in March 2011. In such cases of unpreventable disaster, preparedness and DRR measures are essential. Any post-flooding recovery activities should aim to reduce the risk of future flooding and therefore minimise the levels of future investment required for response, both nationally and internationally. The international aid effort in response to the flooding crisis in Thailand is currently in the region of US$20 million, which is noticeably low when compared to the current estimates of damage costs.

In 2010, 27% of funds were spent multilaterally and 9% were spent bilaterally, whereas in 2009 17% of funds were spent multilaterally and 14% were spent bilaterally.

In terms of humanitarian income, it portrays an overall prevalence of private funding over governmental and other sources of income. More specifically, income generating activities appear to be a considerable source of financing for National Societies and an income strategy that clearly differentiates them from most other NGOs and civil society organisations. In terms of expenditure, the study shows that domestic activities outweigh the international aid programmes for all National Societies participating in the research. This finding, while not unexpected for the Colombian Red Cross, may be regarded with surprise for the other National Societies that are based in high-income countries.</p>\n<p>Although this exercise gives an insight into the funding patterns of only seven National Societies, when replicated on a larger scale it could provide valuable information on volume and trends within the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. While the global reach of the Movement \u2013 based on its worldwide presence and its network of volunteers \u2013 is well understood, a more complete funding picture will enable a better assessment of the full financial scale and weight of the Movement within the delivery system, thus emphasising its influence. It could also lead to improved coordination across the Movement, enabling better programmatical decisions and more effective assistance for those in need.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Non-DAC donors and the transparency of aid informa...", "author": [], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "21 Mar 2011", "description": "The Global Humanitarian Assistance (GHA) programme supports the aid transparency agenda and advocates for improved access to aid information.

Without access to detailed, timely and transparent information it is impossible to say how much aid is being given, by whom, where it is going and when. An inability to answer these simple questions limits our potential to evaluate the impact of aid. There are many initiatives committed to making aid more transparent, such as the <a href=\"http://www.aidtransparency.net/\">International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI)</a>. IATI, which currently has 18 signatories, aims to make information about aid spending easier to access, use and understand through the development of a standard.</p>\n<p>Non-DAC donors, a group of donors that sits outside the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC) member group, are often considered to provide limited aid information which is difficult to access; they are not subject to the same reporting obligations as the OECD DAC donors. However, a number of non-DAC donors do report to the OECD DAC and have done so for a number of years (see figure 1).</p>\n<p>[table id=18 /]</p>\n<p><strong>Figure 1: Non DAC donors reporting to the OECD DAC. [Source: OECD DAC]</strong></p>\n<p>In recent years the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has taken significant steps to make its aid more visible. In 2008 it established the\u00a0Office for the Coordination of Foreign Aid (OCFA), an independent body whose role is to support the delivery and implementation of UAE\u2019s development and humanitarian aid. OFCA\u2019s primary task is to collect, analyse and report all aid flows from the UAE since 1971. In 2010 it reported its 2009 aid information to the OECD DAC\u00a0 separately from the \u2018Arab countries\u2019 grouping and is the first non-DAC donor to report disaggregated data to the OECD DAC Creditor Reporting System (CRS). This means that a detailed breakdown of the UAE\u2019s aid can now be analysed. For more details on the UAE\u2019s aid flows see a recent <a href=\"http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/the-united-arab-emirates-reports-to-the-dac-one-step-closer-to-better-aid-information-2117.html\">blog</a>, \u2018The United Arab Emirates reports to the DAC: one step closer to aid information?\u2019</p>\n<p>Despite this, we do not have an accurate figure for the aid expenditure of many non-DAC donors, let alone detailed data on their humanitarian aid contributions. \u00a0To fill the gaps we currently rely on the United Nations (UN) Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Financial Tracking Service (FTS), a real-time database containing humanitarian aid data from a number of donors, including non-DACs. In 2009, 90 non-DAC donors reported their humanitarian aid information to this database.</p>\n<p>However, the FTS is not without limitations as it relies on donors voluntarily reporting their information. As a result, not all flows are captured. We expect that the aid contributions of some non-DAC donors are in fact far higher than the levels reported. A look at Turkey\u2019s humanitarian aid proves this point. In 2005 alone Turkey reported aid contributions of US$78.7 million through the FTS compared to the substantially higher US$237.7 million through the OECD DAC. Figure 2 shows some of the key non-DAC donors\u2019 humanitarian aid volumes alongside the degree to which they report their humanitarian aid information. \u00a0For example, the UAE reports to multiple databases such as the FTS, OCFA, the DAC and the CRS and was also the largest non-DAC donor of humanitarian aid in 2009.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/NDD-map-3.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2863\" height=\"333\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/NDD-map-3-444x333.png\" title=\"NDD-map-3\" width=\"444\"/></a></p>\n<p><strong>Figure 2: Non-DAC donors\u2019 humanitarian aid volumes compared to reporting of humanitarian aid.

If these figures are anywhere near correct, <strong>(2)</strong> that represents a staggering loss of output for a programme that cost US $485 million in 2009.\u00a0<strong>(3)</strong></p>\n<p>Recently, an NGO programme manager described to Development Initiatives a typical dilemma facing humanitarian organisations working in Somalia: they were almost certain their local partner, a Somali NGO, was corrupt and could not be certain they were even delivering assistance affected populations, though they could find no evidence of corruption in the organisation\u2019s audit trail. The NGO felt that if they terminated the partnership, they would have no footprint inside Somalia and therefore no capacity to respond if the humanitarian situation rapidly deteriorated. This, she explained, was the dilemma international humanitarian actors faced, should they resign themselves to a \u2018see no evil\u2019 attitude to corruption in order to retain some ability to deliver some assistance to Somali\u2019s in desperate need, or should they pull out altogether and leave them to their fate?</p>\n<p>This is hardly a new problem and it is certainly not unique to WFP or to Somalia. However, the extent to which humanitarian actors have found themselves compelled to rely on sub-contracting in acutely insecure environments has escalated significantly just as aid to precisely these environments has seen a rapid upturn. The potential for aid corruption to finance nefarious elites and to further destabilise is entirely at odds with the growing donor interest in official funding for \u2018stabilisation\u2019, which has seen a twenty fold increase in spending on conflict, peace and security-related activities between 1998 and 2008. <strong>(4)</strong></p>\n<p>Concerns about aid effectiveness and transparency are resonating in key donor capitals in 2010. Last week, the US Congress put a freeze on US$3.9 billion USAID and State department funding to Afghanistan requested in the 2011 Foreign Operations budget pending further investigation of reports and allegations of diversion, corruption and obstruction of US aid in Afghanistan. <strong>(5)</strong> Meanwhile, the new coalition government in the UK has affirmed their commitment to transparency in UK aid with a focus on results and outcomes over inputs. <strong>(6)</strong></p>\n<p>Humanitarian assistance is desperately needed by millions of people affected by conflict, turning off the taps is not an option \u2013 humanitarian assistance saves lives in conflict and in fact aid already falls far short of the humanitarian needs of populations in conflict. Aid transparency is crucial but aid in conflict requires an even higher level of accountability throughout the chain of delivery. Donors and delivery agencies operating in highly insecure environments have struggled to keep pace with the challenges to accountability that operating in highly insecure environments with very limited humanitarian access afford combined with growing funding portfolios. Donors and delivery agencies need to urgently develop new modes of operating, new approaches to targeting and accounting for resources and new standards for partnership that revisits the adage to \u2018do-no-harm\u2019 if they are to avoid inadvertently fuelling conflict and allowing scarce resources to benefit those for whom it was never intended.</p>\n<p><strong>(1)</strong> Other factors explained as: \u2018First, the long-term forces that have been driving mortality rates down in the developing world in peacetime continue to have an impact in wartime. Second, the relatively small and geographically concentrated armed conflicts that are typical of the current era rarely lead to enough excess deaths to reverse the long-term downward trend in peacetime mortality.\u2019 <em>Human Security Report 2009, </em>published by the Human Security Report Project</p>\n<p><strong>(2)</strong> It is important to note that WFP has contested the evidence used in the UN Monitoring Group\u2019s report.</p>\n<p><strong>(3)</strong> Figures as cited in <em>Report</em> <em>of the Monitoring Group on Somalia pursuant to Security Council resolution 1853 (2008)</em>, 10 March 2010</p>\n<p><strong>(4)</strong> Spending by OECD DAC donors</p>\n<p><strong>(5)</strong> See \u2018House Panel Slashes USD4B from Obama\u2019s Development Budget\u2019 2<sup>nd</sup> July,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.devex.com/en/news/house-committee-slashes-usd4b-from-obama-s/68240\">http://www.devex.com/en/news/house-committee-slashes-usd4b-from-obama-s/68240</a></p>\n<p><strong>(6)</strong> See excepts of UK Secretary of State for International Development, Andrew Mitchell\u2019s speech announcing creation of a \u2018UK aid watchdog\u2019 on 3<sup>rd</sup> June 2010, <a href=\"ttp://www.dfid.gov.uk/media-room/news-stories/2010/mitchell-full-transparency-and-new-independent-watchdog-will-give-uk-taxpayers-value-for-money-in-aid/\">http://www.dfid.gov.uk/media-room/news-stories/2010/mitchell-full-transparency-and-new-independent-watchdog-will-give-uk-taxpayers-value-for-money-in-aid/</a></p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Humanitarian aid in the DAC context", "author": [], "format": "Commentary blogs", "date": "08 Jul 2010", "description": "In DAC reporting, humanitarian aid is a sector of ODA that aims specifically to \u201csave lives, alleviate suffering and maintain and protect human dignity during and in the aftermath of emergencies.\u201d It includes: disaster prevention and preparedness, reconstruction relief, relief coordination, protection and support services, emergency food aid and other emergency/distress relief.
