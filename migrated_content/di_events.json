Development Initiatives (DI) is running \u2018Building coherence between crisis, development and peace actors\u2019, a series of webinars that aim to bring together actors from all sides to lay the foundations for future talks on building greater coherence.</p><p>The first webinar \u2018What do emerging trends in development finance mean for crisis actors?\u2019 will provide actors working in fragile and crisis contexts with information on development financing processes, structures and trends. Participants will have the chance to hear from development and crisis finance experts, pose questions and explore the possibilities for joint working towards financing for collective outcomes.</p><p>The nature of crises is changing. Crises have become increasingly complex and protracted in nature, and a growing proportion of the world\u2019s poor people will live in fragile and crisis-affected contexts by 2030.</p><p>These shifts in the context \u2013 and deepening links between poverty, vulnerability and crisis \u2013 have reinvigorated the argument calling for greater coherence in the responses of crisis and development actors in protracted crisis contexts. Increasingly, there is more recognition of the need for longer-term development approaches in crises and a heightened awareness that working coherently to address the needs of vulnerable people can strengthen effectiveness.</p><p>Against this backdrop, several global policy processes have emerged \u2013 including the \u2018New Way of Working\u2019 emerging out of the World Humanitarian Summit (2016), the Grand Bargain commitments (2016), the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the new DAC Recommendation on Humanitarian-Development-Peace nexus agreed earlier this year.</p><p>However, while there is growing consensus for a longer-term development approach, and coherence at the international level, it is commonly acknowledged that development and crisis-financing actors operate in silos and the practical delivery of these commitments is the biggest challenge. Additionally, historical divides in the development and crisis-financing architectures continue to provide insufficient space for systemic joined-up working.</p><p>\u2018Building coherence between crisis, development and peace actors\u2019 will provide a series of opportunities for inclusive discussion of these key issues, and a chance to build consensus around the next steps towards more effective ways of working.

This task requires a new focus on disaggregated data to look at people, not averages, to understand who is being excluded and in what ways. The P20 are the people in the poorest 20% of the population globally, and for Agenda 2030 to be implemented, they must be tracked to ensure they are included in progress. Otherwise, they risk being left further behind.</p><p>The Governments of Switzerland and Benin have been using the idea of the P20 to examine the extent to which the poorest 20% of people are included in progress in their own countries. The purpose of this event is to examine advances in implementing the commitment to leave no one behind at country level. Reflecting the universal nature of the challenge, Benin and Switzerland are looking in parallel at their own data, statistics and approaches to ensure that everyone is included in progress. Initial lessons, challenges and experiences from both countries will be shared at this event, and will inform the 2019 HLPF on Empowering People and Ensuring Inclusiveness and Equality.</p><p>To let us know whether you are able to come, please <a href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/eXL6sHa7bBsdxmtk2\" target=\"_blank\">RSVP here</a>.

The rule changes are expected to be adopted at the next High Level Meeting in October 2017.</p><p>This free webinar will provide an overview of the key changes likely to be agreed in October. These include: changes to rules on ODA loans and debt relief; new purpose codes and sector codes; changes to in-donor refugee costs; the introduction of new forms of aid aimed at \u2018mobilising\u2019 private investments for development; and new peace and security related activities.</p><p>Participants will learn the basic facts about how modernised ODA will work, how this might affect incentives for DAC donors in their aid allocations, and how reported ODA numbers might be affected. We\u2019ll also share a timeline for the process and its implementation.</p><p>The webinar is intended for those working directly on ODA policy and advocacy, as well as stakeholders in the wider aid community who need to understand the context for their work. Participants will have the opportunity to put questions to DI\u2019s ODA experts in dedicated discussion time and to share their views on ODA modernisation with other webinar participants.</p><h4><strong>This event is in the past, click below to watch the recording</strong></h4><p><strong>Webinar:</strong>\u00a0<a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/oda-modernisation-background-paper-changing-rules-aid/\" target=\"_blank\">How is aid changing?

How does the concept of the Data Revolution help policy makers meet their agreements on pursuing the SDGs?</li>\n</ol><p>In the <em>East Africa Chronic Poverty Report</em> to be published by DI, it is estimated that 25 million people are in long-term poverty in the region. The report concludes that East Africa has a very high number of people trapped in extreme and chronic poverty. This presents a major challenge to the region\u2019s growth and development progress.</p><p>While reflecting on the outcomes of the Addis Ababa conference, the vice president of the Association of German Development NGOs (Venro) Professor Christa Plath noted that a lot more should be done than just polices being formulated. <em>\u201cA major challenge that we are facing is that we have global policies but no global framework for implementing development. Ultimately, we are living in a world of global irresponsibility\u201d</em> she said.</p><p><em>\u201cAs a region, we must strive to ensure that growth is sustainable, inclusive and equitable all at the same time, and this may pose some challenges\u201d</em> \u2013 Mr. Charles Lwanga-Ntale, Regional Director for DI Africa Hub.</p><h4>The East African context</h4><p>Different countries in the East Africa region struggle with the same issues only different in scale and context. Some of the crosscutting challenges as well as opportunities are elaborated on below:</p><p>1. Ownership of projects and development</p><p>There is a sense of disconnect between the national and subnational levels of administration. The subnational levels of government and communities are viewing the MDGs and SDGs as national government programmes. In some cases communities are yet to understand how the actualisation of the development goals would impact on their lives.</p><p>For the SDGs to be realised, there is a need for ownership of the projects at the national and subnational levels. Governments in the East Africa region need to find strategies of sensitising the citizens and having them own the processes of realising the SDGs in Africa.</p><p>2. Governance</p><p>The role of politics in the actualisation of development goals cannot be a neglected. The low trust issues that have troubled political institutions in East Africa and Africa at large need to be addressed to realise progress.</p><p><em>\u201cIt is critical for us to find ways to make political and government institutions high-trust institutions because, if we don\u2019t, it will be impossible to use their resources adequately, effectively responsibly and with integrity\u201d</em> \u2013 Hon. \u00a0Zein Abubakar, Member of Parliament, East Africa Legislative Assembly.</p><p>3. Planning/visioning processes (aligning global agreements to national and subnational processes and instruments)</p><p>There have been planning and visioning processes[1] by countries in the region. We must bring all the visions of the various countries to speak to each other. We must harmonise and integrate these visions so as to achieve their goals collectively as a region.</p><p><em>\u00a0\u201cWe must bring all these visions of different countries to speak to one another to achieve development together as a region\u201d</em> \u2013 Hon.\u00a0 Zein Abubakar, Member of Parliament, East Africa Legislative Assembly.</p><p>4. Data Revolution</p><p>Data should be prioritised by countries in the East Africa region when planning. The Data Revolution needs to move from talking about it to actioning it in terms of quality, accessibility and use of data and how we can create frameworks at subnational, national, regional and continental levels. Data should not only be used for monitoring what we have done but also to plan for what we have not done.</p><p><em>\u201cThe Data Revolution does not only speak of putting data in the hands of people, and using data not just for monitoring what we have done as we have done in the past, but also on how can we use data to plan for what we do not have.\u201d</em> \u2013 Crystal Simioni , Programme Development Manager at HIVOS.</p><p>Another feature of the plan for the SDGs (as distinct from the MDGs) is the grouping of peace and security issues under the development banner. The reason is that conflict impacts whether countries advance in their development or not.\u00a0For Africa, putting peace and security into the SDGs directs attention to conflict-preventing factors such as equity, inclusiveness and rule of law.</p><p>Further climate change is an emerging issue that the SDGs must address. International development agencies and green groups believe that delivering sustainable development and tackling climate change go hand in hand.</p><p>In their current form, the SDGs are more focused on building productive capacity and give more weight to economic and environmental factors, which are also key features of the \u2018Common African Position (CAP) on the post-2015 development agenda\u2019. The CAP was the consensus of African leaders, civil society and the private sector.</p><h4>Where do we go from here?</h4><p>DI believes there a number of steps that should be put in place in order to deliver on the SDGs to be adopted this September. We continue to work with <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/new-partnership-help-east-africans-access-use-understand-statistical-data-information\">partners</a> to enhance their capacity to collect, understand and use data. We strive to lead in analysis and understanding what it would take to mobilise and raise resources and how all resources will contribute in achieving the SDGs.</p><p>Some of the initiatives that we have been undertaking are to lead in the <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/launch-of-the-development-data-hub-in-uganda\">realisation of a data revolution</a> in East Africa to aid in planning and resource allocations.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.vision2030.go.ke/\">Kenya vision 2030</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"http://npa.ug/uganda-vision-2040/\">Uganda Vision 2040</a></p>"}, {"title": "KODI reaches out to data users", "date": "08 Jul 2015", "format": "Event", "description": "In 2010, Kenya adopted a new constitution.

Many African countries, including those in East Africa, still grapple with development challenges as poverty and inequality persist. Facilitating access to data and information for citizens, governments, development partners, private sector, and civil society is now viewed as one of the ways to bolster socio-economic growth that leaves no one behind. However, challenges remain despite improvements being made by governments in making data available. Many citizens, civil society organisations (CSOs) and decision makers find it difficult to access timely, relevant and sufficiently disaggregated data. Those who are able to access it quite often lack the capacity to make sense of it, or even effectively use it.</p><p>Development Initiatives (DI) has been engaging with multiple stakeholders on the importance of access and use of data and information at the global, regional, national, sub-national and community levels, with the ultimate aim of contributing to the end of extreme poverty by 2030. DI sees access to information as a necessary tool for effective decision making, planning and resource allocation. Even before the call for a data revolution by the High-Level Panel, we were already engaging multiple stakeholders in Uganda under the auspices of the <a href=\"http://opendevdata.ug/\">Uganda Open Development Partnership Platform</a>, an initiative aimed at facilitating access to official and non-official data, and lately <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/interoperable-data-uganda\">Joined Up Data Uganda</a> (JUDU), that seeks to facilitate access to joined up data for better decision making at the district level in the country.</p><p>DI first launched the Development Data Hub in Washington DC on 17 April 2015. It is a comprehensive online resource for financial and resource flow data alongside poverty, social and vulnerability indicators. It is now being launched in Uganda as part of an effort to contextualise the access to national and sub-national level data. It combines an extensive data store with interactive visualisations enabling the user to chart, map and compare poverty, vulnerability and financial resource flow data at the global, national and sub-national/local government level. It brings together several data sets, allowing cross-country comparisons of data down to sub-national level.</p><p>It is envisaged that the Development Data Hub will make it easy for researchers, CSOs, community-based organisations, policy makers, media and other data users to analyse, interpret and make well-informed decisions based on credible evidence.

Innovations in financing and global processes taking place during 2015 and 2016 \u2013 from the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk.\u00a0Reduction to the Financing for Development process and the World Humanitarian Summit \u2013 offer particularly important opportunities to shape global strategies across the development and humanitarian spheres for years to come.</p><p>Providing an evidence base for the search for solutions to these challenges of resourcing humanitarian action, the Global Humanitarian Assistant (GHA) Report 2015 will be launched online on Thursday 18 June.

What are the implications of these trends for future humanitarian financing and how do they impact the global processes taking place in 2015 and 2016?

Globally, over a third of funding requirements went unmet in UN-coordinated humanitarian appeals alone during 2013 (with only US$8.5 billion of US$13.2 billion UN-coordinated appeal requirements met). Despite the emergence of new donors, the number, scale and severity of crises is outstripping resourcing. At the same time, humanitarian assistance is being called on to cover an ever-widening agenda from preparedness to recovery.</p><p>The scale of needs calls for a different response. New and innovative sources of funding must be found and scaled up, and at the same time, existing resources must be used more effectively. Strengthening the effectiveness of the humanitarian response and filling the current funding gap through new approaches to financing is a topic of growing international interest and a central component of the consultations in the lead up to the <a href=\"https://www.worldhumanitariansummit.org/\">World Humanitarian Summit</a> in 2016, the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/esa/ffd/\">Financing for Development</a> consultations, and the UN Secretary-General\u2019s High-Level Panel on Humanitarian Financing.</p><h3><strong>Format of the workshop</strong></h3><p>Panellists will discuss current trends, challenges and opportunities in humanitarian financing \u2013 namely localising response and ensuring access to flexible, predictable funding in acute crises \u2013 while also speaking about the opportunities afforded by global agendas to reform humanitarian financing.</p><p>Breakout groups will focus on the following issues</p><ol>\n<li>Nationalising and Localising Humanitarian Response</li>\n<li>The Development and Humanitarian Nexus</li>\n<li>Embracing diversity to ensure sufficient humanitarian funding</li>\n<li>Moving towards a proactive ways of working to better meet peak demands</li>\n<li>Upgrading the Humanitarian Architecture to address inefficiencies and strengthen needs-based funding.</li>\n</ol><p>The outcome of these discussions will feed into the ECOSOC High-Level Panel discussion on humanitarian financing as well as into relevant global processes.</p><p>Opening remarks will be given by the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p><p><strong>Key note speech: </strong>Kyung-wha Kang, Under-Secretary-General and Emergency Relief Coordinator (OCHA)</p><p><strong>Chair:\u00a0</strong>Anke Reiffenstuel, Deputy Head Task Force Humanitarian Aid, Ministry of Foreign Affairs Germany</p><p><strong>Panellists</strong></p><ul>\n<li>Sophia Swithern, Global Humanitarian Assistance (GHA) Programme Manager</li>\n<li>Lydia Poole (FHF)</li>\n<li>Robert Piper, UN Deputy Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process &amp; UN Regional Humanitarian Coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territories (oPt)</li>\n<li>Claus Sorenson, Director General, ECHO</li>\n<li>Thomas Gass, Assistant Secretary-General for Policy Coordination and Inter-Agency Affairs in UN DESA</li>\n<li>Fatou Diagne Zaouini, Risk Management Advisor, Africa Risk Capacity</li>\n</ul><p>Please follow the event on Twitter at #2015HF and follow the report discussion at #GHA2015</p><p>\u00a0</p>"}, {"title": "Webinar: Understanding ODA loans", "date": "02 Jun 2015", "format": "Event", "description": "Event: Understanding ODA loans: a growing source of development financing Date: June 24, 2015 9.00am-10.00am BST Location: Online The use of loans as a mec", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/understanding-oda-loans-a-growing-source-of-development-financing/", "body": "<p>9.00am-10.00am BST</p><p><strong>Location:</strong> Online</p><p>The use of loans as a mechanism for delivering development assistance has been an increasing trend in recent years, with the rise in ODA loans growing much faster than the rise in ODA grants.

However, this growth has not translated into commensurate poverty reduction or an improvement in the lives of the most poor. The <a href=\"http://www.ug.undp.org/content/uganda/en/home/presscenter/articles/2014/12/08/uganda-poverty-status-report-2014-launched.html\">2014 Poverty Status Report</a> in Uganda shows that despite stable growth the combined number of Ugandans that are either poor or vulnerable to poverty is 63% of the population, or 21.4 million. The broad-based growth agenda of Uganda differs from a pro-poor growth approach such as that adopted by Tanzania, which offers better prospects for the poor and vulnerable.</p><p>In both countries there is a case for financing social protection programmes to safeguard the poorest populations. (ii)\u00a0As part of the <strong>UNICEF speaker\u2019s series on financing social protection</strong> in these two countries, it was highlighted that finding fiscal space for social protection programmes was an important policy priority.</p><p>In the case of Uganda, analysis of fiscal space involved identifying additional revenue sources to bolster the country\u2019s ability to pay. This involves increasing the scope and effectiveness of existing revenue sources. Key questions to be considered include: is further investment in social protection affordable and feasible? Are social protection investments feasible in light of budget deficits and low revenue collection? Is social protection sustainable given the large number of dependents among Uganda\u2019s population? (iii)</p><p>Meanwhile in Tanzania tax revenue analysis suggests broadening the tax base and reducing tax exemptions and tax evasion rates. Specifically, tax exemptions need to be more pro-poor, tax evasion needs to be countered through stricter legislation, and additional tax revenue sources such as airspace tax could be explored.</p><p>Fundamental to financing social protection in both Tanzania and Uganda is the political commitments by policy makers to find the fiscal space that will resource these programmes. Social protection should be seen as investment rather than expenditure to lift the most vulnerable people out of extreme poverty by 2030.</p><p>\u00a0</p>"}, {"title": "High-Level Conference on the Data Revolution in Africa: Defining the next steps for data communities", "date": "16 Apr 2015", "format": "Event", "description": "This is a conference that was unique in many aspects.

Survey results led to 15 \u2018<a href=\"http://www.uneca.org/sites/default/files/page_attachments/program_and_procedural_notes_for_the_high-level_conference_on_data_revolution.pdf\">data communities</a>\u2019 being created: groups with common interests related to the objectives of the data revolution. The groups self-organised with leadership from a convening organisation that mobilised stakeholders to contribute ideas to the final <a href=\"http://www.uneca.org/sites/default/files/page_attachments/final_adc_-_english.pdf\">African Data Consensus</a> (ADC) document \u2013 a key output of the High-Level Conference that was adopted by the 8th joint ECA-AU Conference of African Ministers of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development on 30 March 2015.</p><h3><strong>Convening the Development Data Community</strong></h3><p>As a <a href=\"http://www.uneca.org/datarevolution/pages/partners\">partner</a> to the organisers, alongside <a href=\"http://paris21.org/\">PARIS21</a>, <a href=\"http://beta2.statssa.gov.za/\">South African Statistics</a> and <a href=\"http://webfoundation.org/\">World Wide Web Foundation</a>, <a href=\"http://devinit.org/\">Development Initiatives</a> (DI) also convened the \u201cDevelopment Data Community.\u201d In the lead up to the conference, DI Africa Hub in partnership with <a href=\"https://east-africa.hivos.org/?_ga=1.176647590.260431671.1425672376\">Hivos East Africa</a> and <a href=\"http://www.developlocal.org/\">Local Development Research Institute (LDRI)</a> held a meeting of Kenyan participants to discuss effective ways to engage during the conference. The main outcome of the meeting was a vision and set of principles shared with a group of organisations across the continent and with the conference organisers.</p><p>As a convenor of the Development Data Community, DI drafted a paper responding to a set of questions presented by organisers and shared this with over 50 stakeholders across the continent for input. Their feedback was compiled into a final draft shared with organisers, other communities, and tabled on the first day of the conference on 27 March as the official Development Data community paper for deliberation and further input. DI invited Mr Alex Ezeh, Executive Director at APHRC, and Dr. Bitange Ndemo, former Permanent Secretary in the ICT Ministry in Kenya, among other high profile individuals, to join community discussions and further enrich the paper. Pleasantly surprising, the organisers did not have a draft Africa Data Consensus document before the meeting and relied on the communities\u2019 input for content \u2013 perhaps a first for this nature of conference. We also discovered there were no separate meeting rooms for the communities, and we had to find space within the conference room for the discussions.

It further proposed that National Statistics Development Strategy encompass all activities relating to collecting data and compiling statistics.</p><p>The paper further emphasised the important<strong> role of development data in driving evidence-based development decision making</strong>. Beyond monitoring development the community recognised the need for development data to drive development. Decision-makers therefore need usable information based on data that is disaggregated down to the local level and is both timely and accurate. Those who hold them to account also need this information (and the data on which it is based) to be openly accessible. The community was happy that most of its <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e_Dqk8a8H1VhhJLPzOFFUUIrL6TxWDmoqmvAJBz-yYE/edit\">recommendations</a> were taken on board in the final consensus document.</p><p>Speaking during the event, Mr Charles Lwanga-Ntale, DI Africa Regional Director, also a member of the High-Level Panel that adopted the consensus document, said that the Data Revolution was not going to be achieved just for the sake of it, but had a clear purpose to help Africa achieve higher level goals. He cautioned against the revolution getting consumed by technicalities and technology, missing the real targets \u2013 ordinary people. He further emphasised the centrality of development data in the poverty eradication agenda of the continent, calling on stakeholders to actively promote national level initiatives that could leverage effective partnerships.</p><div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_8407\" style=\"width: 565px\"><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/High-Level-Conference-on-the-Data-Revolution-in-Africa-1.jpg\"><img alt=\"The Community and Citizen Data community (foreground) organised by Hivos East Africa and other communities engage their members during the conference\" class=\"size-large wp-image-8407\" height=\"370\" sizes=\"(max-width: 555px) 100vw, 555px\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/High-Level-Conference-on-the-Data-Revolution-in-Africa-1-555x370.jpg\" srcset=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/High-Level-Conference-on-the-Data-Revolution-in-Africa-1-555x370.jpg 555w, http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/High-Level-Conference-on-the-Data-Revolution-in-Africa-1-320x212.jpg 320w\" width=\"555\"/></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Community and Citizen Data community (foreground) organised by Hivos East Africa and other communities engage their members during the conference</p></div><h3></h3><h3><strong>Charting the way forward: Data Revolution for Africa</strong></h3><p>On the last day of the conference (30 March), DI was tasked by community members to convene a stakeholders\u2019 meeting to reflect on the immediate outcomes of the conference, find practical ways to engage beyond the conference, and forge a loose network to share materials, experiences and ideas. A steering committee was established comprising of individuals from INDEPTH Network-Ghana, ONE Campaign-South Africa, IPAR-Senegal, Center for Democratic Development-Ghana, Hivos East Africa-Kenya, and Development Initiatives Africa Hub-Kenya. Each organisation was tasked to lead regional engagements and draw more institutions that were not part of the High-Level Conference. A series of meetings and intense discussions are currently underway. A Google Group (Data Revolution for Africa) has been created to facilitate engagements. The key action points in the consensus document are providing direction, and guiding country level engagements on the Data Revolution in the lead up to the Third International Conference on Financing for Development to be held in Addis Ababa in July 2015.</p><h3><strong>Implementing the African Data Revolution in Kenya</strong></h3><p>At the national level in Kenya, DI is partnering with Hivos East Africa, other like-minded organisations and partners from government, civil society, media and private sector among others, \u00a0to explore how their comparative advantages can be leveraged to \u201cdomesticate, develop and test a local Data Revolution model\u201d at the national, and more importantly, the granular sub-national (county) level in Kenya. This process will be documented to yield a replicable model that could be shared across the region and the world. A meeting is slated for 22 April at DI Africa Hub in Nairobi to kick-start this process.</p><p>For more information contact Davis Adieno at the DI Africa Hub.

These include commitment from governments to ensure their investments \u2013 including private investments \u2013 are assessed for their impact on the lives of the poorest 20% globally. We want to see re-commitment at the highest political levels to ending extreme poverty by 2030, using all available resources to do so, including domestic resources where they are available. We recommend a refocusing of ODA on ending poverty, tightening its current broad mandate. We seek commitment from all governments to invest in better data \u2013 we need disaggregated, timely and detailed data on resource flows, poverty and needs. These ideas will be explored in detail in our forthcoming report <a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ODA-allocation-post-2015_One-pager-12-Nov1.pdf\"><em>Improving ODA allocations for a post-2015 world</em></a>, which launches in January. Meanwhile, you can read more about these ideas in a blog from my colleague Harpinder, <a href=\"http://devinit.org/future-oda-targeting-people-countries-end-poverty-2030/\"><em>Targeting people not countries to end poverty by 2030</em></a>.</p><p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/B6xeJSgCIAEf_bI.jpg\"><img alt=\"B6xeJSgCIAEf_bI\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5450\" height=\"286\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/B6xeJSgCIAEf_bI.jpg\" width=\"599\"/></a></p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>The final push to end poverty: a universal goal</h3><p>Many speakers noted the shift towards a universal development agenda and asked: how can we engage the American public in the goals? This is a debate now being examined by researchers and policymakers in many developed countries \u2013 see for example this <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/security/report/2014/05/12/89459/applying-universal-goals-to-the-united-states/\">report by the Center for American Progress</a>, or this <a href=\"http://www.post2015datatest.com\">blog by Shannon Kindornay on the Canada context</a>.</p><p>Other speakers outlined the importance of engaging all actors \u2013 including the private sector \u2013 in the Addis conference. The <a href=\"http://www.aidtransparency.net/news/using-iati-to-track-ffd\">importance of IATI in improving resource flow data</a>, and the need to engage the general public in the sustainable development goals to ensure a truly global push to end poverty, combat climate change and provide economic opportunity for all, were also addressed. The progress already made on the Millennium Development Goals was highlighted by Tom Hart, CEO of ONE, who pointed out that the development community must shout about its successes to jolt politicians out of complacency and seek commitment for the final push to end poverty.</p><p><strong>To learn more about DI\u2019s priorities for the Addis conference, contact \u00a0<a href=\"mailto:info@devinit.org\">info@devinit.org</a>.</strong></p>"}]
