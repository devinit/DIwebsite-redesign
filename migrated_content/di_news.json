Preliminary OECD data indicates that the UK is one of only five DAC members that fulfilled this pledge in 2018, and it is encouraging to see this continuing commitment reflected in yesterday\u2019s Spending Round.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn order to build on this achievement and ensure all UK aid delivers for the world\u2019s poorest people, it is vital that these funds are spent in ways that maximise the impact on global poverty. That means sharpening the focus of UK aid on the people and places where need is greatest, and prioritising the interventions that can make the greatest difference to peoples\u2019 lives.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo safeguard this focus on poverty, it is also important that the highest levels of transparency are maintained when it comes to aid spending. With an increasing proportion of aid being spent by government departments other than DFID in recent years, it\u2019s more important than ever that practitioners, policymakers and the public can see how money is being spent. Therefore all government departments should be meeting the transparency standards adhered to by DFID by publishing timely, comprehensive and forward-looking data on their aid spending to the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI).\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Notes to editors:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Development Initiatives (DI) is an independent international development organisation that focuses on the role of data in driving poverty eradication and sustainable development.

Development Initiatives has responded to this review by focusing particularly on data and financing to deliver on the Leave No One Behind agenda.</p>\n</div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>Harpinder Collacott, Executive Director at Development Initiatives said, \u201c<em>We welcome a comprehensive and thoughtful report from the UK on its progress on all 17 Sustainable Development Goals at home and abroad, and applaud the extensive use of data to demonstrate progress on the goals. We are pleased to see that the pledge to Leave No One Behind emerges as a central theme, however it is vital that the UK\u2019s use of aid reflects this priority better than is currently the case.</em></p>\n<p>\u201c<em>The UK review also highlights critical gaps in data and the fact that there is limited disaggregated data, making it difficult to identify who is most risk of being left behind. If the UK is facing this challenge, a country that has data on 74% of the indicators, this will be an uphill struggle for developing nations where data systems are weak and patchy. The UK\u2019s leadership in tackling this issue will be important and is particularly welcome when such information is the only way to ensure everyone is included in progress between now and 2030.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>There are four key points on Leave No One Behind worth noting in particular:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The UK has reported on 74% of the 244 SDG indicators, one of the highest levels of coverage in the world. However, data is lacking for 64 indicators, and there are insufficient levels of disaggregation to identify who might be being left behind. We are pleased to see the VNR make the link between Leave No One Behind and the importance of counting people and having good quality disaggregated data in order to make this possible. The UK\u2019s international leadership in this area is welcome and is a reminder that UK aid must focus on supporting countries to increase their statistical capacity in a way that ensures people are being counted.</li>\n<li>The VNR reaffirms the UK\u2019s commitment to meeting the 0.7% Gross National Income target, and the target of spending at least 0.15\u20130.2% in the Least Developed Countries. While this is welcome, it should be noted that the proportion of UK aid invested in the Least Developed Countries has actually been decreasing \u2013 failing to 28% in 2016 and 29% in 2017, down from 39% in 2011,\u00a0after peaking at 41% in 2001. The UK government should reverse this trend and increase funding to the countries and people who need it the most and are at risk of being left behind.</li>\n<li>Similarly, while the VNR notes that the UK\u2019s contribution to social protection schemes is meeting the Goal 1.1 target, it fails to acknowledge that UK funding to this area has declined sharply from US$431 million (3.7% of gross bilateral ODA) in 2016 to US$263 million (2.2% of gross bilateral ODA) in 2017. The commitment to Leave No One Behind implies that more, rather than less, should be invested in the poorest countries, and in core human capital priorities such as social protection, health and education \u2013 to ensure everyone has an equal start in life and can benefit from the opportunities growth has to offer.</li>\n<li>Finally, the UK\u2019s VNR emphasises the central importance of inclusive economic growth in driving progress. While few would dispute this sentiment, there is no agreed definition of what inclusive growth looks like, and DI\u2019s analysis confirms that the income gap between the poorest 20% and the rest is growing globally, and in most countries, despite economic growth. This highlights the fact that current patterns of growth are not sufficiently inclusive to achieve the ambitions of Agenda 2030 in eradicating poverty, reducing inequality and leaving no one behind. Government policies need to support growth to ensure the benefits are more inclusive and that specific groups of the population are not missing out.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "DI's response to new aid spending figures", "author": [], "format": "News; Press release", "date": "10 Apr 2019", "description": "Development Initiatives responds to new aid spending figures released by the OECD in April 2019, which show that official development assistance has dropped", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/18238/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>Today, the OECD published <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-data/ODA-2018-detailed-summary.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">aid spending figures from official donors in 2018</a>, which show official development assistance has dropped, especially to countries with the highest levels of need.</p>\n<p><strong>Harpinder Collacott, Executive Director at Development Initiatives, said </strong>\u201cODA\u00a0is a critical resource for financing efforts to end extreme poverty and support the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals for many countries, especially those where other resources are limited. Furthermore, we are just over a decade away from the 2030 deadline for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals but progress against most of the goals remains slow and a substantial financing gap estimated to be as high as US$3.1 trillion persists. Therefore, it is disappointing today to see ODA decrease at this critical juncture, especially as that decrease seems to be hitting some of the poorest people, and countries where the need is greatest.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe figures released today should serve as a stark warning that we cannot get complacent about achieving the SDGs. Unfortunately, donors are not living up to the commitment they made in 2015 to increase financing to deliver the SDGs and the figures show only five out of 30 are giving 0.7% of their GNI in aid. If this decrease is not reversed, the world may be further off-track in fulfilling the global promise to end extreme poverty by 2030 and leave no one behind.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Notes to editors:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Development Initiatives (DI) is an independent international development organisation that focuses on the role of data in driving poverty eradication and sustainable development.

The incomes and therefore livelihoods of the poorest 20 per cent have virtually stagnated over the last two decades despite all forms of finance \u2013 international and domestic \u2013 showing considerable growth overall.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/investments-to-end-poverty-2018/\" target=\"_blank\">Investments to End Poverty 2018</a></em> finds that despite poverty rates halving under the MDGs, millions of people are not sharing in progress \u2013 the income gap is worsening as the rest of the world continues on a positive trajectory. The income of the poorest 20% of the population was $0.94 in 1990 and is only $1.90 today, while the rest of the population\u2019s income grew from an average $12.85 to $18.63 over the same period. This inequality is projected to worsen \u2013 with an income gap of $18.79 by 2030 \u2013 almost double what it was in 1990. The research shows that while the resources that underpin growth are not targeted or mobilised to ensure the poorest people are not left behind, these poverty trends will continue.</p>\n<p>Harpinder Collacott, Executive Director at Development Initiatives, said <em>\u201cWhile it is common knowledge that global poverty is not reducing fast enough, a crucial point often overlooked is that a particular set of people and countries are not progressing while the rest of the world\u2019s population are seeing their incomes steadily improve. The poorest 20 per cent of our world\u2019s population, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, are facing a bleak future under business as usual. While money will not solve poverty alone, we are seeing aid being diverted away from the poorest and most vulnerable people. And while increasing amounts of other finance such as private, commercial and domestic public resources give us reason for optimism, they are simply not currently enough to enable rates of progress to really improve for the very poorest in the world.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>The report finds that despite global commitments to zero poverty, actors are not putting their money where their mouth is. Aid donors promised in 1970 to give 0.7% of their GNI to fighting poverty, and yet the average spend today is 0.31% \u2013 lower than it was then (0.33%). The research also found that if actors met their commitments, an extra US$1.5tn would be available between now and 2030 to help lift the very poorest in the world out of poverty. There is also a lot more to improve on in terms of where aid is spent \u2013 proportionately more aid per person goes to developing countries with the lowest levels of poverty. The good news is this means that despite being off track to eradicate poverty, there is a lot of scope and opportunity to change this trajectory.</p>\n<p>While development actors are rightly looking at ways to mobilise all types of finance to fund the global poverty agenda, the data contained in the report makes it clear that it is domestic public financing and international aid that are so fundamental to reaching those being left behind. Agenda 2030 puts the responsibility on all actors to deliver the SDGs \u2013 sustainable development must be a core element across all forms of finance and will require resources and expertise of all sectors to achieve success. The mobilisation of new and additional financing can release aid to be focused on those furthest behind.</p>\n<h3>Contact</h3>\n<p>Anna Hope, Head of Communications at Development Initiatives</p>\n<p>E: <a href=\"mailto:Anna.Hope@devinit.org\" target=\"_blank\">Anna.Hope@devinit.org</a></p>\n<p>T: +44 (0) 1179 272 505\u00a0/ +44 (0) 7545668378</p>\n<h3>About Investments to End Poverty</h3>\n<p>DI\u2019s <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/projects/investments-end-poverty/\" target=\"_blank\">Investments to End Poverty programme</a> delivers data-driven evidence, policy research and new ideas to shape international development finance for delivering the 2030 Agenda.</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Harpinder Collacott appointed to Bond board", "author": [], "format": "News", "date": "30 Jul 2018", "description": "DI\u2019s Executive Director Harpinder Collacott has joined the board of Bond, the UK network for organisations working in international development.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/harpinder-collacott-appointed-to-bond-board/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"><p><em>DI\u2019s Executive Director Harpinder Collacott has joined the board of Bond, the UK network for organisations working in international development.</em></p>\n</div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>As one of ten elected trustees, Harpinder will contribute to setting the strategy for <a href=\"https://www.bond.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Bond</a> and supporting the organisation in its goal: to help eradicate global poverty, inequality and injustice.</p>\n<p>With a membership of more than 400 civil society organisations, Bond is the largest international development network in the UK.

If the needs of the poorest people are not well targeted by government resources, or if insufficient tax is raised (or raised in ways that penalise the poor), and if welfare support systems are under or inefficiently financed, people with most need are at the greatest risk of being left behind.</p>\n<p>The government plans to spend Ksh 2.53 trillion \u2013 an increase of 8.75% from 2017/18 fiscal year. Revenue collection is projected at Ksh 1.92 trillion. Fiscal deficit is expected to reduce by 10.21% to Ksh 562.75 billion despite the increase in spending. The deficit will be financed through domestic and external borrowing. Development expenditure has increased by 12.77% to Ksh 657.29 billion compared with 2017/18. This amount is equivalent to 25.95% of the budget, which is less than the minimum threshold of 30% provided for by the Public Finance Management Act, 2012. And transfers to county governments have increased by 15.13% to ksh 372 billion.</p>\n<p>Angela Kageni, Head of Development Initiatives\u2019 Africa Office says: \u201c<em>as the government rolls out the Big Four Agenda, access to and use of quality data in planning and budgeting should be prioritised. Lack of adequate and reliable data was mentioned in the 2018/19 programme-based budget as a constraint to allocation of funds to institutions that are implementing basic education programmes for instance. More regular collection of disaggregated data through measures such as improving interoperability and automatic data collection should be considered.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Development Initiatives\u2019 analysis provides an in-depth look at allocations to sectors that are considered to have a direct reach and effect on the poor population. It shows that although the Kenyan government is allocating more resources to pro-poor sectors in 2018/19 compared with previous years, these resources still do not adequately address the needs of the most vulnerable citizens. Financial gaps in many priority areas may result in Kenya being off-track to meet the targets set as part of national development priorities and Sustainable Development Goals.</p>\n<p>The analysis in the report is limited to the national government budget estimates. Deeper insights on allocations to pro-poor sectors could be explored by analysing county government budgets as well.</p>\n<p>\u2013 ENDS \u2013</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Contact</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/people/henry-odhiambo/\" target=\"_blank\">Henry Odhiambo</a>, Engagement and Partnerships Manager, Development Initiatives</p>\n<p>T: +254 (0) 20 272 5346</p>\n<p>E: <a href=\"mailto:Henry.Odhiambo@devinit.org\">Henry.Odhiambo@devinit.org</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Spokespeople available on request</strong>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/people/angela-kageni/\" target=\"_blank\">Angela Kageni</a>, Head of Africa Office, Development Initiatives</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/pro-poor-analysis-kenyas-201819-budget-estimates/\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full report and briefing</a></p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Angela Kageni appointed Head of Development Initiatives\u2019 Africa Office", "author": [], "format": "News", "date": "24 May 2018", "description": "Angela will ensure DI continues to deliver its vision: to end poverty and build a world where everyone shares in the benefits of opportunity and growth.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/angela-kageni-appointed-head-of-development-initiatives-africa-office/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"><p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/people/angela-kageni/\" target=\"_blank\">Angela Kageni</a> has been appointed Head of Africa Office, leading Development Initiatives\u2019 (DI\u2019s) operations in Africa.</p>\n</div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>Having joined DI in April 2016 as Senior Manager for Strategic Partnerships &amp; Data Use, Angela brings a wealth of knowledge about DI\u2019s work in the region to her new role.

Only four of the 10 government donors that provided the most assistance in 2015 increased their contributions in 2016, and there was a significant decrease in contributions from others.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/global-humanitarian-assistance-2017/\">Global Humanitarian Assistance Report 2017</a> finds that international humanitarian assistance increased for the fourth consecutive year in 2016, reaching US$27.3 billion, an increase of US$1.5 billion over 2015 figures. At 6%, the growth in humanitarian assistance between 2015 and 2016 was considerably smaller than in the previous three years, which showed increases of 12% in 2015, 21% in 2014 and 18% in 2013.</p>\n<p>The slowdown was in part caused by a 24% decrease in funding from governments in the Middle East and North of Sahara region, following several years of successive increases. Decreases were largely driven by a 50% reduction in reported contributions from the Government of Kuwait, as well as reduced funding from Qatar (down 57%) and Saudi Arabia (down 26%).</p>\n<p>Conversely, contributions from European governments grew by 25% between 2015 and 2016. Notable increases included contributions from Germany, with an additional US$1.4 billion in 2016 (increase of 109%), Belgium (58%), Denmark (51%) and France (41%). These figures represent international humanitarian assistance and do not include domestic spending on hosting refugees.</p>\n<p>Development Initiatives estimates that over 164 million people globally were in need of international humanitarian assistance during 2016, another year of multiple conflicts and disasters contributing to refugee crises. Over a quarter of those in need were living in just three countries: Yemen (21.2 million people), Syria (13.5 million) and Iraq (10.4 million).</p>\n<p>Echoing trends in recent years, humanitarian assistance reported to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs Financial Tracking Service was concentrated on a few large crises in 2016, and five received more than half of all funding (54%): Syria, Yemen, Iraq, South Sudan and Ethiopia. These were all severe crises with some of the largest populations in need. They have also all been in receipt of significant levels of humanitarian assistance for extended periods, due to ongoing or recurrent crises.</p>\n<p>Harpinder Collacott, Executive Director at Development Initiatives, said, \u201c<em>Poverty, crisis and risk are intrinsically linked. An estimated 87% of people living in extreme poverty are in countries that are considered environmentally vulnerable, fragile or both. This means that effectively preparing for and responding to crises is critical, not only to save lives and alleviate suffering, but also to achieve a sustainable end to global poverty by 2030</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Furthermore, we need a holistic set of financing tools and sustained investments to deal with the causes and long-term consequences of crises. Understanding the resources that are available is an important first step.

If the current annual growth rate were continued, private capital mobilised through blended finance would total US$42 billion by 2020 and US$252 billion by 2030 \u2013 well short of the SDG funding gap.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Many countries which face the toughest challenges in achieving the SDGs \u2013 countries with high rates of poverty and very low government revenues \u2013 receive little or no investment from blended finance. LICs that received private capital investment through blended finance each received, on average US$62 million of this type of finance between 2012 and 2014, the equivalent figures for middle-income countries were US$370 million for LMICs and US$392 for UMICs.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Most private capital mobilised through blended finance is directed to the energy, industry, mining, construction and banking sectors. These sectors received two-thirds of the private capital mobilised through blended finance between 2012 and 2014. Some sectors, such as education, biodiversity and water &amp; sanitation face large funding gaps in relation to the SDGs, but receive relatively little investment through blended finance.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved transparency of blended finance is critical. At present, judgements on the usefulness of blended finance in development are hampered by the quality and consistency of data that is available on such investments.

Despite this, allocations of adaptation finance do not prioritise the countries most vulnerable to its impacts: in 2014 total adaptation approvals were greatest to the 49 countries with mid-range vulnerability scores. Some of the most vulnerable countries such as Eritrea, Guinea-Bissau, Sierra-Leone and Liberia received particularly little \u2013 less than US$10 million each compared with an average of US$65 million.</li>\n<li>The 14 countries with the deepest levels of poverty (&gt;20%), received among the lowest amounts of total adaptation finance \u2013 a 2014 average of US$56 million per country, compared with an average of US$73 million in 67 countries with poverty depths of less than 5%. Support was especially low to Micronesia, Lesotho and Togo, which received less than US$10 million each.</li>\n<li>Countries with the highest vulnerability to climate change, and the lowest domestic revenues to build capacity to respond, receive some of the smallest amounts of adaptation finance. For example, Sudan and Burundi \u2013 with the highest levels of vulnerability and lowest government revenues \u2013 received relatively small amounts of adaptation support (US$31 million and US$39 million respectively in 2014), much less than the country average of US$65 million.</li>\n<li>While mitigation finance is distributed fairly proportionately against patterns of greenhouse gas emissions, support is lacking to a number of countries with significant mitigation needs and relatively low domestic government resources, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nigeria \u2013 each also home to high populations of extremely poor people.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The report recognises that climate change threatens to reverse progress towards tackling vulnerability and building resilience, as well as having the potential to create new forms of poverty. It argues that, for these reasons, resources aimed at tackling climate change must be allocated after careful consideration of their impacts on the world\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable people.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u2013 Ends \u2013</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Contact:</strong> Emma Cooke, Communications Officer</p>\n<p><strong>E</strong>: emma.cooke@devinit.org</p>\n<p><strong>T:</strong> +44 (0) 1179 272 505</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Notes to editors:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Daniel Coppard, Director of Research, Analysis and Evidence, is available for interview.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.devinit.org/climate-finance-and-poverty\" target=\"_blank\">The full report is available here</a>.</li>\n<li>Charts and data can be provided, and can be used with the following credit:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>If using our data and figure:</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p><em>Data analysis and figure development by Development Initiatives: </em><a href=\"http://www.devinit.org\"><em>www.devinit.org</em></a></p></blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>If using our data and redesigning your own figure:</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p><em>Data analysis by Development Initiatives: </em><a href=\"http://www.devinit.org\"><em>www.devinit.org</em></a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p></blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>About Development Initiatives</strong></p>\n<p>Development Initiatives (DI) is an independent international development organisation that focuses on the role of data in driving poverty eradication and sustainable development.

It has received increasing attention from the international community in recent debates, including being highlighted in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda as an innovative way for traditional aid providers to incentivise increased \u2018development friendly\u2019 investments.</p>\n</div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>Ambitious Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have been agreed by UN member states, but there is a significant financing gap for developing countries aiming to meet these goals, estimated at trillions of US dollars annually. This gap is very unlikely to be filled by official development assistance (ODA). Many of the least developed countries (LDCs) will face severe challenges in mobilising enough domestic resources to meet these financing needs. In this light, the private sector is increasingly being considered by development actors for its role in the new \u2018global partnership for development\u2019 and in mobilising finance to fill these gaps.</p>\n<p>The target to increase use of public\u2013private partnerships for financing development is now explicit in the SDG agenda. The use of blended finance mechanisms is already being significantly scaled up by both bilateral and multilateral donors. However, there is a limited stock of evidence on the impact of blended finance mechanisms on development, and a lack of clarity regarding which instruments are most effective in which contexts hampering informed policy dialogue and decision-making. There are also recognised challenges with blended finance, but these are not well understood and there is no common language between the many different stakeholders who play a role in delivering it.</p>\n<p>In response to these needs, we at Development Initiatives are launching a project that seeks to address the evidence gap and drive policy making so that resources can be targeted where they are most needed and developing countries can reap the benefits of blended finance. Using available data, we will explain the basics, such as how much finance there is, who gives it and where it is being spent, and go further to provide evidence and analysis on complex issues, such as the effectiveness and impact of blended finance.</p>\n<p>The <strong>objective</strong> of our work is to contribute to evidence-based policy dialogue, ultimately ensuring blended finance mechanisms are delivering better development cooperation for people and supporting the achievement of the SDGs in line with effectiveness principles. The <strong>rationale</strong> underpinning this approach is our strong belief that projects financed through blended mechanisms should, like other forms of development cooperation, have sustainable, positive impacts for the poorest people in developing countries.</p>\n<p><strong>We will deliver the following:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1) Analyse</strong>: map and describe blended finance flows and key actors, including developing case studies; identify and analyse challenges, opportunities and issues with blended finance mechanisms currently in use.</p>\n<p><strong>2) Apply</strong>: considering our evidence and the views of key stakeholders, develop pragmatic and progressive policy recommendations in line with our objectives.</p>\n<p><strong>3) Engage</strong>: using clear, accessible data and evidence, engage with key stakeholders and processes to promote understanding and influence policy change.</p>\n<p>Our first\u00a0data-driven report will be launched online in October 2016 and the research programme will continue after that.</p>\n<p><strong>If you would like to know more about our work on blended finance, please contact:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rob Tew: Analysis and Research \u2013 <a href=\"mailto:rob.tew@devinit.org\" target=\"_blank\">rob.tew@devinit.org</a></li>\n<li>Cecilia Caio: Analysis and Research \u2013 <a href=\"mailto:cecilia.caio@devinit.org\" target=\"_blank\">cecilia.caio@devinit.org</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.devinit.org/blended-finance-understanding-its-potential\" target=\"_blank\">Read our blended finance report<br/>\n</a><a href=\"http://devinit.org/the-role-of-blended-finance-in-the-2030-agenda-setting-out-our-analytical-approach/\" title=\"The role of blended finance in the 2030 Agenda: setting out an analytical approach\">Read our first discussion paper on blended finance<br/>\n</a><a href=\"http://devinit.org/aligning-blended-finance-to-busan-principles/\" target=\"_blank\">Read our second discussion paper\u00a0on blended finance</a><a href=\"http://devinit.org/the-role-of-blended-finance-in-the-2030-agenda-setting-out-our-analytical-approach/\" title=\"The role of blended finance in the 2030 Agenda: setting out an analytical approach\"><br/>\n</a></p>\n<p>Homepage photo credit:\u00a0Gavin Houtheusen/DFID</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "New research highlights Africa\u2019s challenge of both protracted and forgotten humanitarian crises", "author": [], "format": "News; Press release", "date": "27 Jun 2016", "description": "New research by Development Initiatives finds that Ethiopia has been in the largest 10 recipients of humanitarian assistance every year for the last decade", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/new-research-highlights-africas-challenge-of-both-protracted-and-forgotten-humanitarian-crises/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>New research by Development Initiatives finds that Ethiopia has been in the largest 10 recipients of humanitarian assistance every year for the last decade, and the Democratic Republic of Congo has featured as a main recipient for nine of the last 10 years \u2013 making these recurrent and protracted crises two of the most significant still ongoing today. For the first time since 2004, Sudan and Somalia are not on the list of ten largest recipients of assistance however both countries remain high on the list (in eleventh and twelfth place respectively, according to latest available official data).</p>\n<p>The Global Humanitarian Assistance Report 2016, published today, also found that a record total of US$28 billion was given in humanitarian assistance last year, but that the funding for crises differs significantly across countries. While some African countries are receiving large amounts of assistance, the continent also has a number of prominent forgotten crises. Gambia experienced the largest shortfall in funding requirements via UN-coordinated appeals. Algeria has appeared on the European Commission\u2019s Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department\u2019s Forgotten Crisis Assessment index every year since 2004, while Libya and Egypt appear on the 2015 index for the first time.</p>\n<p>Harpinder Collacott, Executive Director at Development Initiatives, said \u201cAs crises in the Middle East attract greater donor attention, other crises, many of which are in Africa, attract much less attention and as a result are persistently underfunded or forgotten. Funding needs to respond to where the needs are greatest, and making sure crises are not forgotten is vital in efforts to end poverty and ensure no one is left behind.\u201d</p>\n<p>The report also finds that the South of Sahara region witnessed a noticeable increase in the number of people affected by drought and flooding, increasing from 7.6 million people in 2014 to 23.5 million in 2015. Around half (10.2 million people) were in Ethiopia, which ranked third in 2015 for the number of people affected by disasters, behind the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and India. This increase is likely to be associated with the current El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon, the impact of which continues to be felt in 2016. The UN estimates that the number of people likely to be affected this year in developing countries could reach 60 million.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u2013 Ends \u2013</p>\n<p>Contact: Emma Cooke, Communications Officer at Development Initiatives</p>\n<p>E:\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:Emma.Cooke@devinit.org\">Emma.Cooke@devinit.org</a>\u00a0T: +44(0)1179 272505</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Notes to Editors:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The executive summary and full report can be found at <a href=\"http://www.devinit.org/GHA2016\">http://www.devinit.org/GHA2016</a></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Data graphics are available</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Interviews can be arranged with Charlotte Lattimer, Senior Policy &amp; Engagement Adviser, and Sophia Swithern, Head of Research &amp; Analysis</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Key findings include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A record total of US$21.8 billion was given in international humanitarian assistance globally last year.</li>\n<li>In 2014 Syria was the largest recipient of assistance at US$2 billion, followed by South Sudan, Iraq, Palestine and Jordan.</li>\n<li>In 2015 the US was the largest donor of international humanitarian assistance at US$6.4 billion, followed by Turkey (where refugee hosting is included), the UK, EU institutions, Germany, Sweden and the UAE.</li>\n<li>Shortfalls in funding to UN-coordinated appeals grew to 45%, with large disparities in funding between crises \u2013 for example Iraq received 74% of funding requested while Gambia had only 5% of requirements met.</li>\n<li>At least 76% of people living in extreme poverty \u2013 around 677 million people \u2013 are estimated to live in countries that are either politically fragile, environmentally vulnerable or both.

This is the third consecutive annual increase in overall spending, and an increase of 12% from 2014.</p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 Government contributions total 2015: US$21.8bn</strong><br/>\nGovernment donations have increased by almost 11% \u2013 from US$19.6bn to US$21.8bn.<br/>\n\u2013 The US continues to dominate, providing 89% of the regional North and Central America total.<br/>\n\u2013 The UK contributed 27% of the European total.<br/>\n\u2013 Gulf donors have driven an increase in assistance of more than 500% from the Middle East and North of Sahara region over the last four years.</p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 Private contributions total 2015: US$6.2bn</strong><br/>\nEstimates of private donations show an increase of around 13%, from US$5.5bn to US$6.2bn.</p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 Shortfall in funding for UN-coordinated appeals 2015: 45%</strong><br/>\nIn 2015, UN-coordinated appeals, which aim to raise funds from across the donor community to address humanitarian crises, experienced the largest shortfall in funding to date \u2013 45%.</p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 International humanitarian assistance as a proportion of total resources to crisis-affected countries 2014: 5%</strong><br/>\nAnalysis of the 20 countries that received the most international humanitarian assistance in 2014 shows that this resource flow made up only a small proportion of the total funding that plays a role in crisis.</p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 Gap between best- and worst-funded crisis 2015: 69 percentage points</strong><br/>\n\u2013 Most well-funded crisis: Iraq at 74%.<br/>\n\u2013 Most underfunded crisis: Gambia at just 5%.<br/>\nThe shortfall varied from country to country, and in the case of \u2018forgotten crises\u2019 we see particularly severe shortfalls by comparison. Gambia received just 5% of the funding requested in its UN-coordinated appeals. By contrast, the Iraq appeal saw 74% of needs met .</p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 People in extreme poverty who are vulnerable to crisis 2015: 677 million</strong><br/>\nEfforts to end poverty remain closely related to crisis, with 76% of those in extreme poverty living in countries that are either environmentally vulnerable, politically fragile, or both. The situation of these 677 million people highlights the need for development and humanitarian investments to work together and ensure no one is left behind.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>\u2013 Ends \u2013</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Contact:</strong> Anna Abuhelal, Head of Communications<br/>\n<strong>E:</strong> Anna.Abuhelal@devinit.org<br/>\n<strong>T:</strong> +44 (0) 1179 272 505<strong> M:</strong> +44 (0)7545668378</p>\n<p><strong>Notes to editors:</strong><br/>\n1.

The report, <em><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/investments-in-peace-and-security\" target=\"_blank\">Investments in peace and security</a>,</em> found that Chad and the Central African Republic receive particularly low funds given their relatively high levels of fragility. They received US$11.5 million and US$19.8 million, respectively, in 2014 yet score higher on the 2014 Fund for Peace Fragile States Index than Afghanistan, which received US$486 million in the same year. The Ukraine also received considerably more despite being classed as 40% less fragile.</p>\n<p>Sarah Dalrymple, Senior Policy Adviser at Development Initiatives, said, \u201cAid for peace and security is relatively low at just US$3.2\u00a0billion \u2013 dwarfed by US$165 billion of aid spent in total. In addition, we found that some very fragile countries are potentially being missed out when funds are allocated, leaving many vulnerable and crisis-affected people in ever more desperate need. It is crucial that funding is strengthened and better targeted on the basis of the needs of the most vulnerable people\u201d.</p>\n<p>The report also looks at the broader financing picture on conflict and fragility, including US$1.7\u00a0trillion on military expenditure and US$9.7 million on peacekeeping, and calls for urgent improvements to data and reporting on resource flows beyond aid.</p>\n<p>Sarah Dalrymple said, \u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals have created a focus for development actors on \u2018peaceful and inclusive societies\u2019 and humanitarian actors are seeking solutions to the spiralling costs of protracted crises ahead of the World Humanitarian Summit this June. It is therefore crucial that we seize this momentum to look at resources beyond aid \u2013 including domestic, international, public and private \u2013 and ensure they are mobilised as a means of addressing the needs of vulnerable and conflict-affected people.</p>\n<p>\u201cIssues with data gaps and lack of transparency particularly on security resources make it difficult to get an accurate picture of how and where money is being spent. Without better reporting, it will be almost impossible for there to be coordinated efforts between different actors working in fragile contexts to ensure they are meeting the needs of people most affected by crisis\u201d.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>\u00a0\u2013 Ends \u2013</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Contact:</strong>\u00a0Anna Abuhelal, Head of Communications at Development Initiatives</p>\n<p>E:\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:Anna.Abuhelal@devinit.org\">Anna.Abuhelal@devinit.org</a>\u00a0T: +44(0)1179 272505 M: +44(0) 7894442055</p>\n<h3><strong>Notes to editors</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The full report can be accessed at <a href=\"http://www.devinit.org/investments-in-peace-and-security\" target=\"_blank\">devinit.org/investments-in-peace-and-security</a></li>\n<li>ODA \u2013 Official development assistance (commonly referred to as aid)</li>\n<li>CPS \u2013 Conflict resolution and prevention, peace and security</li>\n<li>2014 Fund for Peace Fragile States Index can be found at <a href=\"http://fsi.fundforpeace.org/\">http://fsi.fundforpeace.org/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>About Development Initiatives</h3>\n<p>Development Initiatives is an international development organisation that supports decision makers and others to make sense of existing data on poverty, vulnerability and crisis, and the resources available to address them.

For example, the Department for International Development (DFID) will remain the primary channel for aid, but the strategy makes clear that more aid will be administered by other government departments. These departments are not covered by the International Development Act 2002, which clarified the purpose of aid spending as poverty reduction.

The 18 countries showing the most rapid increase in poverty in the last decade are in sub-Saharan Africa where poverty is also deepest globally. To end poverty by 2030, countries in sub-Saharan Africa will need to reduce poverty at a pace faster than South Asia has achieved in the last 15 years.</p>\n<p>The report also shows that national trends can mask big differences within countries \u2013 even those that are making good progress nationally. Available data indicates that while India reduced poverty by 10 per cent a year over the last 15 years in 10 states, eight smaller states actually saw poverty increase.</p>\n<p>Harpinder Collacott, Executive Director at Development Initiatives, said \u201cHalving poverty has been an incredible achievement, however there are many people who have been left behind.\u00a0 The new Sustainable Development Goals are going to be hugely important for driving forward an even more ambitious agenda specifically focused on leaving no one behind over the next 15 years.</p>\n<p>\u201cExtreme poverty is increasingly concentrated in complex and challenging contexts, and efforts will need to be intensified and better focused if poverty targets are to be met.

It shows that, particularly where poverty is deepest, governments do not have the volumes of revenue needed to implement the Sustainable Development Goals, and that aid has an important contribution to make in reducing poverty, creating stability and reducing vulnerability to shocks. There needs to be much greater visibility across the mix of resources and crucially better targeting of aid to where the poorest people are. This is critical to ensuring we get on track to meet the first Sustainable Development Goal and specifically the target of ending extreme poverty by 2030.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u2013 Ends \u2013</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Contact: Anna Abuhelal, Communications Manager at Development Initiatives</p>\n<p>E: <a href=\"mailto:Anna.Abuhelal@devinit.org\">Anna.Abuhelal@devinit.org</a> T: +44(0)1179 272505 \u00a0M: +44(0) 7894442055</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Notes to editors:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A range of data graphics for the key findings are available.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Harpinder Collacott, Executive Director at Development Initiatives, and Tim Strawson, Programme Lead on <em>Investments to End Poverty</em>, are available for comment or interview.</li>\n<li>\u2018Depth of poverty\u2019 measures the scale of the challenge that each country faces to end poverty.

It is expressed as a percentage of the $1.25 a day poverty line, where a higher percentage means greater depth of poverty and a more significant challenge to ending poverty. Poverty data can be used to tell us numbers of people living below the $1.25 threshold and also, at a national level, how far below the line people are.\u2019</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Key findings include</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Governments in many developing countries raise low volumes of revenue that are not enough to implement the Sustainable Development Goals at the national level. In 24 of the 33 countries where depth of poverty is highest globally, government revenues are less than $1.37 per person a day (adjusted for purchasing power parity, PPP) compared with PPP$34 a day in high income countries.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Low government revenues mean that, although sub-Saharan Africa spends the second highest proportion of revenues on health among all regions, spending per person is the second lowest among them.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Where depth of poverty is greatest, countries are more reliant on indirect taxes. Without careful design this can place a greater burden of tax on the poorest people.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Where poverty is greatest, revenue is projected to have the slowest growth</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The comparative advantage of aid is that it can be targeted more directly at the investments needed to reduce poverty than other resources.</li>\n<li>There is significant room to improve the targeting of aid. 29 per cent of official development assistance (ODA) goes to countries with a depth of poverty of less than 1 per cent, and in 2013 only 9 per cent of ODA commitments to build resilience against environmental shocks went to the most vulnerable countries.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Donor agencies with a stronger mandate for targeting poverty allocate their resources more effectively: over 90% of ODA from agencies with a legal mandate to target poverty go to countries with the lowest government revenues (less than PPP$1,000 per person), compared with 50% from agencies that do not have a specific objective for targeting poverty.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The data that guides efforts to end poverty is not fit for the purpose of ending poverty: just 12 of 55 African countries have comprehensive birth registration and a quarter have not conducted a poverty survey since 2008.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Joined-up Data Alliance: announcement", "author": [], "format": "News", "date": "08 Sep 2015", "description": "A new coalition of open data standards setters, users and advocates bodies has been launched to put the needs of data users at the heart of data standards", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/joined-up-data-alliance-announcement/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"><p><strong>New coalition formed to put users at the heart of data standards</strong></p>\n</div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>A new coalition of open data standards setters, users and advocates bodies has been launched to put the needs of data users at the heart of data standards choices.

Here, we summarise some of the discussions.</p>\n<h3>Uganda\u2019s data revolution and poverty eradication</h3>\n<p>In setting the tone for the discussion, Davis Adieno (Capacity Development Manager, DI Africa Hub) pointed out that the Development Data Hub fits within a broader DI agenda on improving access to information in the fight against poverty. In addition, Charles Lwanga-Ntale (DI Regional Director, East &amp; Central Africa) emphasised the need to unbundle the statistics (an attribute the data hub provides) because many questions and details do not come across when looking at the figures without context.</p>\n<p>As global consensus is attained on the <a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015\">Sustainable Development Agenda</a> (which is already reflected in Uganda\u2019s recently launched second <a href=\"http://npa.ug/development-plans/ndp-201011-201415/\">National Development Plan</a>), it was widely acknowledged at the launch that availability of quality data is central to the realisation of the associated goals as well as eradication of poverty.</p>\n<h3>Quality data availability in development</h3>\n<p>Timely and reliable statistics are what quality data is made of, a phenomenon emphasised by Bright Kimuli, Senior Statistician at the <a href=\"http://www.ubos.org/\">Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBoS)</a>. In presenting the views from UBoS he emphasised the need for standards (international and national) in order to attain consistence and comparability across years and contexts.</p>\n<h3>Presentation of the Development Data Hub</h3>\n<p>The Development Data Hub was presented with a specific focus on Uganda, clearly showing what it can do and how it can be used. In addition to introducing the current aspects and visualisations of the Data Hub (including the <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/data\">global</a> picture, unbundling of <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/unbundling-aid\">aid</a> and <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/country/uganda\">Uganda</a> country profiles), a preview of the Spotlight on Uganda was showcased. This forthcoming feature will provide details of government finance, demographics, population, poverty statistics and outcome performances in education and health at the district level in Uganda.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2r.png\"><img alt=\"Spotlight on Uganda\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9245\" height=\"619\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2r.png\" width=\"851\"/></a></p>\n<p>The Development Data Hub was then officially launched by <a href=\"http://npa.ug/about-npa/authority-board-members/\">Dr Abel Rwendeire</a>, the Deputy Chairperson of the National Planning Authority (<a href=\"http://npa.ug/\">NPA</a>), who emphasized the need for further appreciation of data, identifying where the gaps are and how they can be filled. He was particularly enthusiastic about the Spotlight on Uganda and its potential use for decision making within the government.</p>\n<p>The event concluded with different aspects of the Development Data Hub being showcased on screens throughout in the room, which proved a very popular avenue to answer specific questions that participants had with regards to the data (sources, authenticity and validity, among others).</p>\n<h3>Looking ahead</h3>\n<p>Feedback received from participants at the launch event was very positive, with the majority of participants considering the Data Hub to be either relevant or extremely relevant to their work. All expressed high demand for all forms of data held within the Data Hub.

The project will also support collaboration between open publishing standards in fields such as development cooperation, humanitarian relief, public contracting and natural resource governance to ensure that the data generated through these systems is fully interoperable.</p>\n<p>The project aims to establish the technical and political rationale for the creation of an international working group to provide sustainable leadership and governance for joined-up data standards.</p>\n<p>Announcing the new project, Harpinder Collacott, Director of Engagement and Impact at Development Initiatives, said:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\u201cData has the potential to revolutionise the development landscape. However, this will only happen when data can be brought together to become information that can inform decisions. To achieve this DI has launched this project to find solutions to overcome data silos and ensure data can be combined and contextualised.

Working to support partners at national levels in Uganda, Kenya and Nepal and providing information and analysis on global resource flows, DI helps decision makers to use information to increase their impact on the poorest people in the most sustainable way. With its technical expertise, DI has been instrumental in developing and supporting the IATI standard for aid flows. In this project, DI will be the lead implementing partner focusing on the critical technical aspects and on engaging expert stakeholders.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Publish What You Fund </strong>is the global campaign for aid transparency. Its mission is to achieve a significant increase in the availability and accessibility of comprehensive, timely, comparable and accessible information about development flows. Its primary focus is advocacy for the publication of information in common, open, accessible formats. Publish What You Fund has been a highly effective advocate for aid transparency, for example through its work on the Aid Transparency Index, encouraging the take up of IATI by leading aid providers. In this project, it will focus on engaging decision-makers to build momentum towards joined-up data standards through constructive advocacy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Global Humanitarian Assistance Report 2015", "author": [], "format": "News", "date": "19 Jun 2015", "description": "Our Global Humanitarian Assistance programme has published its annual report", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/global-humanitarian-assistance-report-2015-2/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"><p>Our Global Humanitarian Assistance programme has published its annual GHA report; the most comprehensive overview of global humanitarian finance.</p>\n</div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>The spotlight is on financing to address crisis, vulnerability and risk as never before. This is for two reasons \u2013 the urgent challenge of attempting to meet rising humanitarian needs with limited resources, and the unique opportunities to find solutions presented by a suite of global processes in 2015 and 2016. The Global Humanitarian Assistance (GHA) Report 2015 provides the evidence to understand the former and to inform the latter.</p>\n<p>The GHA Report 2015 shows that poverty and vulnerability to crises are intrinsically linked and that international humanitarian assistance continues to go predominantly to long-term recipients. This emphasises the need to build resilience, address the underlying causes of crisis and meet the long-term needs of people affected by crisis. For this to happen, a shared responsibility between humanitarian, development, climate change and other actors is critical as is the mobilisation of other resources beyond humanitarian assistance.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/GHAreport2015/\"><strong>Explore the key findings and download the report via our GHA website.</strong></a></p>\n<h3>Key findings of the report include:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>International humanitarian assistance rose for a second year running to a record US$24.5\u00a0billion in 2014. All of 2013\u2019s largest donors gave more in 2014, and many gave their largest amounts. Despite this rise, funding was not sufficient to meet needs. In response to the scale of need in 2014, UN-coordinated humanitarian appeals requested the highest amount of funding to date \u2013 a total of US$19.5 billion \u2013 yet a record US$7.5 billion of requirements went unmet.</li>\n<li>2013 saw a shift in the geography of displacement \u2013 with more people displaced now in the Middle East than in Africa. As a result, Gulf donors rose in prominence, and Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) became the 6th and 15th largest government donors, respectively.</li>\n<li>Two thirds (66%) of international humanitarian assistance continues to go to long-term recipients such as Syria, Somalia and Pakistan, as crises are protracted or disasters recur in the same places year on year.</li>\n<li>An estimated 93% of people living in extreme poverty (defined as less than US$1.25 a day) are in countries that are either fragile or environmentally vulnerable or both, emphasising the need to address the underlying causes of crises.</li>\n<li>Domestic response and capacities often play an important role in best meeting needs and reducing the need for international finance, as case studies of Turkey and Mexico show.</li>\n<li>Of total international humanitarian assistance, only 0.2% went directly to local and national NGOs and 3.1% to the governments of affected states.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The report uses unique methodologies to gather and analyse data to provide the most up-to-date and comprehensive picture of global humanitarian financing. It includes in-depth analysis of international financing to national and local actors, as well as wider resource flows to the most crisis-affected, fragile and environmentally vulnerable countries.</p>\n<p>We have produced this report annually since 2000, to present a shared and independent evidence base for anyone engaged in providing, using, receiving and understanding assistance in crisis settings. In a year when financing for crisis preparedness and response is under scrutiny as never before, our report provides the data to inform discussion, which we hope will deliver change.</p>\n<p>We are hosting an <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/key-trends-in-humanitarian-financing-what-do-they-mean-for-future-resourcing-to-address-crises-risk-and-vulnerability\">event</a> with online streaming options for an international audience in London on <strong>6 July 2015</strong> to discuss the implications of the report\u2019s findings on the future of humanitarian financing. <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/key-trends-in-humanitarian-financing-what-do-they-mean-for-future-resourcing-to-address-crises-risk-and-vulnerability\" target=\"_blank\">Find out more and register.</a></p>\n<p>All of the data contained within this report is available to <a href=\"http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/report/gha-report-2015\" target=\"_blank\">download</a>\u00a0from our GHA website.

Launched in April 2015, the <strong>Development Data Hub</strong>\u00a0helps answer questions such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What kinds of development finance are going into a country, where are they from, and are they allocated according to need?</li>\n<li>How does the distribution of resources look against poverty levels in a country, and specifically in areas such as health, education and employment?</li>\n<li>What are countries really sending and receiving when you \u2018unbundle\u2019 resources like aid and official development finance?</li>\n<li>What domestic revenue does a national government raise, where from, and how is it allocated?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What is the Development Data Hub?</h3>\n<p>It\u2019s the most comprehensive online resource for financial and resource flow data alongside poverty, social and vulnerability indicators. It combines an extensive data store with interactive visualisations enabling you to chart, map and compare poverty, vulnerability and financial resource flow data at the global, national and local level.</p>\n<h3>How does it work?</h3>\n<p>It brings together many data sets, enabling you to dig into these through interactive maps, charts and visualisations. It turns complex data around poverty and resource flows into easy to understand robust information and evidence about what is really going on.

DI is responsible for convening the development data community, one of twelve working groups that between them will draft the outcome document. Each community is tasked with articulating key concerns of practitioners and experts across the continent who produce and use data that supports decision making to reduce poverty and achieve better development outcomes.</p>\n<p>DI maintains that such decisions, by governments and other development stakeholders, require information that primarily builds on data grounded in the counting of people wherever possible, not a calculation of populations and their needs. In particular, this implies the need to strengthen civil registration and administrative data collection systems, supported by robust National Statistics Development Strategies.</p>\n<p>To have an impact on poverty reduction and development outcomes, this data must drive decision making, not merely support the monitoring of progress. This necessitates ownership of the data revolution at national level, and the disaggregation of data down to the very local level where decisions are taken that affect the lives and livelihoods of people.</p>\n<p>Our initial consultations with practitioners and experts (including substantial input from colleagues at the <a href=\"http://aphrc.org/\">African Population and Health Research Center</a>) indicate an emerging consensus around these themes in the African development data community.

But, right now, we think it is time for donors to set their sights higher and to think about the bigger picture.</p>\n<p>As the world looks to establish new global goals beyond 2015 \u2013 to build on the success of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), to actually end poverty and ensure that no one is left behind \u2013 we need to ensure that ODA is fit for this next fifteen years, not trapped in the thinking and approaches of the last fifty.</p>\n<p>To achieve this, there are five things that those around the table need to have at the front of their minds. Get these right and everything else will follow.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong> Aid (ODA) is, and will remain, really important up to 2030</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Developing the policy, resourcing and implementation frameworks\u00a0to deliver on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and end poverty within every country is primarily the responsibility of national governments. But it is clear that the first SDG \u2013 ending extreme poverty \u2013 will not be achieved, or sustained, without aid. Whilst there is plenty of room for better policies and more effective implementation of programmes to help the poorest, it is beyond argument that some children are denied education and that some women can\u2019t access reproductive health services or care in childbirth because of sheer lack of money.</p>\n<p>Levels of government expenditure are just too low to achieve the MDG targets, let alone the broader set of SDGs, which aim to ensure that by 2030 no one is left behind.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Over 300 million people currently living below the extreme poverty line are in countries where total government expenditure is less than $500 per person per year.</li>\n<li>Even the most optimistic projections on domestic resource mobilisation show that national government resources will not be enough.</li>\n<li>Aid remains the single largest source of external finance for 34 countries, which are home to 150 million people living on less than $1.25 a day.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We should not be misled by talk about ODA now being only about leveraging, catalysing and investing in global public goods. ODA remains vital for the delivery of basic services and to address fundamental aspects of extreme poverty, like hunger and vulnerability to crisis.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong> Intention matters. The explicit purpose of ODA should be poverty reduction</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The official purpose of ODA is currently \u2018economic development and welfare of developing countries\u2019. This may have been appropriate in the 1960s when aid was the main flow to countries who were unable to access much private finance or mobilise many domestic resources; but it is not in 2014, when ODA comprises just 8% of the total international resource flow going to developing countries. Now that market finance is available for investments in energy and infrastructure, now that domestic revenues are growing fast, we need to target aid on investments that the market still isn\u2019t making and where government and the private sector are still not providing adequate services.</p>\n<p>That means <a href=\"http://devinit.org/future-oda-targeting-people-countries-end-poverty-2030/\">reserving aid to ensure basic rights and needs for the poorest 20%</a> \u2013 health, education, nutrition, water and sanitation, access to information, basic financial security and opportunity. Which is actually what the taxpayers who fund aid want and expect their money to be doing.</p>\n<p>You might think that changing the definition of ODA would just be a cosmetic difference. But the data suggests that it could have a real impact on how aid is invested. As things stand:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>8% of ODA is invested by donor agencies with a <strong>legal requirement</strong> to ensure the purpose of their ODA is poverty reduction; these donors spend 80% in poorer countries.</li>\n<li>43% is invested by agencies where poverty<strong> reduction is their top objective</strong>; 60% of their aid goes to poorer countries.</li>\n<li>30% of ODA is from agencies that either have <strong>no explicit poverty objective or where poverty is one among many</strong>; less than 30% of this aid goes to poorer countries.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A decision by DAC donors collectively that the purpose of ODA should be poverty reduction would signal a new future, a deeper commitment to the first SDG and the achievable goal of ending poverty by 2030.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong> Measurement of the incomes and wellbeing of the poorest 20% of people should be the benchmark of progress</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Resource allocation decisions or finance eligibility determined by national average income, let alone by arbitrary thresholds that have become icons of progress like middle income status, are simply not compatible with the geography of poverty or the concept of leaving no one behind. We need a measure that focuses on people in poverty as well as on countries. Impact on the poorest 20% should be the main metric for targeting resources on ending poverty.</p>\n<p>Currently least developed countries (LDCs) are home to more than a third of people in the poorest 20%. The depth of poverty is also much greater in these countries \u2013 the average daily income among people in the poorest 20% living in LDCs is just $1.09. This, combined with very low government expenditure, would justify targeting more ODA on LDCs. But some LDCs are also \u2018middle income countries\u2019 and some \u2018low income country\u2019 non-LDCs have poor growth prospects.\u00a0If ODA is to play to its comparative advantage, then spending in all countries has to be designed to impact\u00a0people who are among the poorest 20% of the population. A metric based on country averages or country groupings is not enough. Read our data story\u00a0<a href=\"http://devinit.org/targeting-poorest-20-case-least-developed-countries/\"><em>Targeting the poorest 20%: the case of least developed countries</em></a>.</p>\n<p>The call for a Data Revolution to end poverty has been reiterated by the UN Secretary General in <em><a href=\"http://www.un.org/disabilities/documents/reports/SG_Synthesis_Report_Road_to_Dignity_by_2030.pdf\">The Road to Dignity by 2030</a></em> published last week. This is a new opportunity to actually produce evidence on two things that have been the subject of too much rhetoric and too few facts for far too long. The data that shows what sorts of aid work best in what sorts of situations and the measure of whether \u2018pro poor\u2019 or \u2018inclusive\u2019 growth really is pro poor: are the poorest 20% of people getting their share of jobs and investment, are governments and the market are reaching them?</p>\n<p>Of course getting the data on poverty \u2013 regular gender disaggregated statistics that cover excluded and vulnerable groups so often missed by official data collection \u2013 will require investment in strong inclusive national information systems. But this investment can be shared between government, the private sector and aid agencies, all of whom have an interest in knowing more about citizens, customers and beneficiaries.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong> Visibility on all resources is a necessary condition for accountability and impact</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Alongside ODA, in 2012 official, commercial and private international investments in developing countries totalled $2.1 trillion. $130 billion of that was DAC ODA, but governments also invested $11 billion in other official flows and $211 billion in peace and security. Citizen remittances were $309 billion, non-governmental organisations and foundations $44 billion, and the private sector invested $1.3 trillion.</p>\n<p>All of this needs to be visible and transparent. Governments and citizens need to know what is being invested in their countries and anyone spending money can do it more efficiently if they know what else is being invested.</p>\n<p>We should not get hung up on classifying what should \u2018count\u2019 as total official support for development. We just haven\u2019t got enough information about the volumes or characteristics of funds to have a measure or a target. But if we just have visibility then people can see the whole range of resources available, governments can get more recognition for what they do and, most importantly, we can start to use the resources together to achieve faster progress. Maybe we should spend less time thinking about whether 6% or 10% of military costs should be \u2018counted\u2019 as ODA or as total official support for development, and focus more on how the remaining 90% could be harnessed more effectively to promote security (and therefore opportunity) for the poorest. This in turn will contribute to security and prosperity for all.</p>\n<p>Earlier investments also mean that we can make fast progress on visibility. Since the Accra aid effectiveness meeting in 2008, in addition to reporting their ODA to DAC, donors (not just OECD countries, but civil service organisations, foundations and other governments) have gone the extra mile to increase transparency at country level by publishing to the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI). With 300 organisations and most donors, <a href=\"http://www.aidtransparency.net/news/using-iati-to-track-ffd\">IATI provides a existing platform that can be developed to publish data on all international development finance.</a></p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><a name=\"_Toc403460439\"></a><a name=\"_Toc403460445\"></a><strong> Think about how change is going to happen </strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>DI would be the last organisation to downplay the importance of the 0.7% target. It has provided a consistent benchmark and driven real progress. But it is not a substitute for mobilising more and better resources or for a focus on the most important outcome \u2013 improvements in the lives of the poorest 20%.</p>\n<p>We would like to see the 0.7% target adapted so it is applicable to all countries at all times as a genuine burden-sharing measure for achieving the eradication of poverty. As we approach the financing for development summit the top task is how to mobilise more and better resources and how to use them most efficiently. So let\u2019s focus on data and a measure that can be used to drive impact on poverty from all resources \u2013 domestic and international, public and private, commercial and philanthropic. What is the impact of every investment on the poorest 20% of people? How are those people\u2019s lives changing for better or for worse?</p>\n<p>The vision for the future of ODA should be informed by the best of its past, its role as a true international public good and example of altruism in international politics. ODA distribution did change in response to the MDGs. To be fit for the next fifteen years it needs to change again: using the power of open and disaggregated data to target impact on people in poverty and get more value out of every dollar; making all resources visible so ODA can play to its comparative advantage and we can harness the power of other finance. Donors have the chance to signal their readiness for this future by setting the official purpose of ODA as poverty reduction and by putting the impact on the poorest 20% at the centre of their work.</p>\n<p>12 December 2014</p>\n<p><strong><em>Later this month Development Initiatives will be publishing a report (Improving ODA allocation for a post-2015 world) commissioned by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) for the Development Cooperation Forum.

Explaining the DAC\u2019s proposed changes to the measurement of ODA", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/much-aid-worth-explaining-dacs-proposed-changes-measurement-oda/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"><p>On 16\u00a0December 2014, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\u00a0(OECD)\u2019s Development Assistance Committee (DAC) finally published its <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/dac/OECD%20DAC%20HLM%20Communique.pdf\">proposals for changes to the measurement of official development assistance (ODA</a>). The most significant change was in the way concessional loans are valued for ODA. The current method of valuing loans has been widely criticised as overstating the benefit of ODA loans to developing countries.</p>\n</div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>Two of the main criticisms are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Under the existing system, any loans with a grant element<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a> of more than 25% are included in the ODA figures in their entirety. This means that loans with low concessionality (just over 25%) are valued the same as highly concessional loans.</li>\n<li>The reference rate<a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\">[2]</a> used in the calculation of the grant element of ODA loans has, for years, been set at the artificially high level of 10%. The outcome of this is an inflated grant element to the extent that even loans at commercial interest rates could be counted as ODA.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The DAC has responded to each of these criticisms by proposing the following changes to the ways loans are valued in ODA statistics:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Only the grant element percentage of the loan, and not the full face value, will be counted as ODA. This means, for the first time, loans with a very high grant element will count for more ODA than loans with a relatively low grant element.</li>\n<li>The flat 10% reference rate will be replaced by a range of rates, based on the International Monetary Fund (IMF)\u2019s reference rate plus a \u2018risk premium\u2019 that depends on the status of the borrower. The \u2018risk premium\u2019 has been set at 1% for upper middle-income countries (UMICs), 2% for lower middle-income countries (LMICs) and 4% for low-income and least-developed countries (LICs/LDCs). Since the IMF reference rate is currently 5%, this gives an effective reference rate of 6% for loans to UMICs, 7% for LMICs and 9% for LICs/LDCs.</li>\n<li>The current 25% grant element threshold will be replaced by a range of threshold values, also based on the income status of the borrower. It is proposed that, in the case of LICs/LDCs, only loans with a grant element of over 45% should be counted as ODA. For LMICs and UMICs the threshold levels will be 15% and 10%, respectively.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The changes in policy towards ODA loans are, on balance, a very positive step.<strong>\u00a0</strong>We have previously highlighted the benefits of <a href=\"http://devinit.org/discussion-paper/discussion-paper-official-development-assistance-loans/\">valuing\u00a0only\u00a0the grant\u00a0element\u00a0of aid loans as ODA</a> and the DAC\u2019s acceptance of this is a\u00a0very welcome\u00a0development.\u00a0The move\u00a0towards IMF\u00a0reference rates\u00a0for loans\u00a0is a step in the right direction, although it can be argued that the differentiated discount rates (DDRs), published by the OECD themselves, are a more realistic basis for reference rates. Still, at least in the case of\u00a0countries classed as \u2018middle income\u2019, we have a significantly lower (and thus more realistic) reference rate.\u00a0However,\u00a0the\u00a0proposed\u00a09% reference rate for\u00a0LICs/LDCs\u00a0is\u00a0only slightly\u00a0lower than the old 10% rate.</p>\n<p>The addition of \u2018risk premia\u2019 to the reference rate also creates a potential danger of over-incentivising donors to lend to LDCs/LICs.\u00a0This is because, under the proposed system a loan to an LDC/LIC will lead to a greater amount of ODA being credited to the donor than for the exact same loan to an MIC.\u00a0For example, a $10 million, 25-year loan at an interest rate of 2% would be counted as $454,000 of ODA if loaned to an LIC, but only $313,000 of ODA if loaned to an UMIC. The 45% grant element threshold for LDCs/LICs will mitigate this potentially perverse incentive to some extent.</p>\n<p>The linking of the ODA rules to the IMF\u2019s debt sustainability rules and the World Bank\u2019s borrowing policy, which was also announced in the DAC communiqu\u00e9, is a positive move and will help to protect LICs against over-lending.\u00a0 It could even be argued that these safeguards are necessary due to the potential incentive to over-lend to LICs/LDCs created by the 9% reference rate.</p>\n<p>In summary, although questions remain around the arguments for using different discount rates for LDCs/LICs and MICs, the other constraints on lending to LICs/LDCs (45% threshold and adherence to IMF debt limitation policy) provide a counterweight to any perverse incentive to over-lend to the poorest countries. Therefore these changes are, overall, welcome.</p>\n<p>The other rules on the valuation of ODA have largely remained unchanged and this is somewhat disappointing. The DAC have failed to take this opportunity to remove\u00a0elements such as imputed student costs and donor-country refugee costs,\u00a0which\u00a0seem set to\u00a0continue to qualify\u00a0as ODA.\u00a0As we highlighted in our <a href=\"http://devinit.org/report/investments-to-end-poverty/\">2013 Investments to End Poverty Report</a> , these two elements alone accounted for over $6.5 billion of ODA reported by DAC donors in 2012, but resulted in no actual transfer of resources to the developing world. A future broader measure of development finance the OECD proposes may be a more suitable way to report these items rather than including them in ODA.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\">[1]</a> The grant element is the standard way of measuring how concessional a loan is. It can be viewed as the difference between the cost, in today\u2019s prices, of the future repayments a borrower will have to make on the loan in question and the repayments the borrower would have had to make on a non-concessional loan. This is therefore the amount of money that is considered to have been \u2018given away\u2019 by the donor, hence grant element. The grant element is normally shown as a percentage of the value of the loan.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref2\" name=\"_ftn2\">[2]</a> The reference rate is a benchmark interest rate used in the calculation of the grant element \u2013 the higher the reference, the higher the grant element. For an accurate measure of concessionality, the reference rate should have some relationship to the market rate faced by the lender.</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "While Uganda\u2019s income rises after rebasing and better population estimates, more work is needed to reduce poverty", "author": [], "format": "News", "date": "05 Jan 2015", "description": "While Uganda\u2019s income rises after rebasing and better population estimates, more work is needed to reduce poverty", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/ugandas-income-rises-rebasing-better-population-estimates-work-needed-reduce-poverty/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>Uganda\u2019s per capita<a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\">[i]</a> gross domestic product (GDP) at constant prices for 2013/14 rose by 115% to US$730 and at current prices by 21.2% to US$788.

The base year provides the reference point to which future values of the GDP are compared.</p>\n<p>Uganda follows other East and West African countries that have rebased their economies recently. Uganda\u2019s 17% change in GDP after rebasing is the lowest in the region, in Kenya it was 24% and in Tanzania it was 25%. Nigeria\u2019s and Ghana\u2019s economies changed by 89% and 62%, respectively, far ahead of East African countries. However, this was mostly due to differences in previous base periods for West and East Africa (<a href=\"http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/gdp-rebasing/175578/\">1990 and 1993 for Nigeria and Ghana, respectively, compared with 2001 for Kenya and Tanzania, and 2002 for Uganda</a>). The more regular the revisions, the better the national income estimates.</p>\n<h3><strong>What changed in Uganda?</strong></h3>\n<p>The 2013/14 GDP rose by 13.1% from the previous base-period estimates, and the population estimate declined to 34.9 million people lower than the predicted value of 35.4 million people. The growth of the economy in 2013/14 remained at 4.5%, slightly higher than 2012/13 (3.3%). Industry and services sectors maintained higher growth (4.3% and 4.2%, respectively) than agriculture (1.5%).</p>\n<p>Services contributed to half (50.2%) of GDP in 2013/14 and the contribution by the agriculture sector continues to decline (from 26.6% in 2009 to 23.3% in 2013). The contribution by taxes was 8.7% in 2013/14, and follows an increasing trend since 2009/10 (7.2%).</p>\n<h3><strong>How reliable is the new data?</strong></h3>\n<p>These GDP estimates are more reliable than those of the 2002 base year, simply because 2009/10 is a more recent year. In addition, restructuring of the economy was based on up-to-date recommended methodology (using the system of national accounts (<a href=\"http://unstats.un.org/unsd/nationalaccount/sna2008.asp\">SNA</a>) 2008 and International standard industrial classification (<a href=\"http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/isic-4.asp\">ISIC</a>) rev. 4 and 2009/10 supply use tables (SUT) as a benchmark) and most recent data sources<a href=\"#_edn4\" name=\"_ednref4\">[iv]</a>.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the major policy implications?</strong></h3>\n<p>The new estimates express Uganda\u2019s economy in a more accurate way. This implies that better decisions and effective policy evaluations can be made, through a better understanding of the structure of the economy, growth drivers in each sector, and sectors where investment resources and more financing should be budgeted. In addition, without accurate GDP figures we cannot make cross-country comparisons or rank countries convincingly.</p>\n<p>Attaining the per capita income of US$1,218 in 2019/20 and US$9,500 in the <a href=\"http://npa.ug/uganda-vision-2040/\">vision 2040</a> is more likely to happen with policies based on these up-to-date estimates.</p>\n<p>Also to note, compared with other countries in the region the proportion of tax-to-GDP ratio in Uganda is very low (at 8.7%). Neighbouring <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2014/cr14120.pdf\">Tanzania has a tax-to-GDP ratio of 16%</a> and Kenya 20%. Sub-Saharan African countries with <a href=\"http://databank.worldbank.org/data/views/variableselection/selectvariables.aspx?source=world-development-indicators#s_t\">tax-to-GDP ratios of greater than 20%</a> are Equatorial Guinea, Seychelles, South Africa, Botswana and Namibia.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the opportunities for focus in Uganda?</strong></h3>\n<p>The continued expansion of the services sector provides room for new opportunities such as accommodation and food services (growth at 11.4%), information and communication (growth at 11.1%), education services (growth at 6.2%), human health and real estate (both at 6.1%).</p>\n<p>Opportunities in the industry sector include mining (growth at 5.6%), manufacturing, water and construction. Uganda is planning to start large-scale crude oil extraction by 2018 after <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/10/uganda-oil-idUSL6N0S53Q720141010\">commercial reserves estimated at 6.5 billion barrels were found in 2006</a>, and this is expected to increase growth in the sector.</p>\n<p>In agriculture, growth is significant in livestock and forestry. Fishing and cash crops experienced negative growth. But with better policies, this sector is expected to attain better growth.</p>\n<h3><strong>After all this, where are we in terms of development, especially the end of poverty?</strong></h3>\n<p>Per capita income growth is normally associated with growth in other development indicators such as absolute poverty, literacy rates, proportion of children immunised, and percentage debt service.</p>\n<p>However, <a href=\"http://www.ubos.org/onlinefiles/uploads/ubos/statistical_abstracts/Statistical%20Abstract%202014.pdf\">some indicators</a> have remained unchanged or experienced insignificant change. For example, the net enrolment ratio in primary education (81.8%); the literacy rate of 15\u201324 year olds (76%); the rate of immunisation against measles (76%); and the proportion of 15\u201324 year olds who have comprehensive knowledge of HIV/AIDS (38.8%).</p>\n<p>Poverty levels and income inequality (Gini coefficient) declined from 24.5% and 0.426, respectively, in 2009/10 to 19.7% and 0.395, respectively, in 20012/13, but these values still show a significant proportion of people who cannot afford basic human needs. Much remains to be done to improve the incomes and secure the livelihood of approximately 43% of the population that is at risk of falling back into poverty in the event of a shock.</p>\n<p>Effort is needed to reduce vulnerability and help build the resilience of individuals and communities, especially in northern Uganda where poverty rates remain high as a result of youth unemployment, gender inequality, lack of access to basic services, and low economic development<a href=\"#_edn5\" name=\"_ednref5\">[v]</a>.</p>\n<p>As observed, a lot needs to be done to reduce the levels of poverty and vulnerability in Uganda. More concentrated effort is needed to improve the quality of life and capabilities of Ugandans as expressed by persistent low literacy rates, poor health status, high unemployment rates, poor education structures and low levels of institutional development.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\">[i]</a> Per capita GDP is the average production per person of goods and services for a specified period, such as one year.

Entitled <b>\u201cIs anybody listening?\u201d</b> the report emphasises the continuing multi-dimensionality of Ugandan poverty. The title refers to <a href=\"http://www.chronicpovertynetwork.org\">what the authors see</a> as as a fundamental disconnect between the Ugandan chronically poor, and Ugandan policymakers; caused by a failure on the part of Ugandan leadership to include poor people in policymaking, as well as a failure to communicate effectively.</p>\n<p>A headline finding of the CPR is that economic growth will likely not be enough to eradicate the chronic poverty which persists in Uganda. The report also finds that targeted social protection policies (as well as policies that ensure inclusion into public services for poorer and marginalised groups), need reviewing and consolidating: to \u201cget rid of those that are not working, and focus effort on those that are or can.\u201d It contains analysis both of the data on those living in chronic poverty, and the social welfare policy environment in Uganda; research carried out largely by local organisations (including support from some of our colleagues in the <a href=\"http://devinit.org/about/africa-hub/\" title=\"The Africa Hub\">Africa hub</a>).</p>\n<p><b>How many poor people in Uganda?</b></p>\n<p>The second chapter of the Uganda CPR was an especially interesting read for us at DI. (We recently reported on the distribution and depth of poverty, relative to governments\u2019 capacity to respond to this challenge, and projected future global poverty trends until 2030, in Chapter 1 of our\u00a0<a href=\"http://devinit.org/report/investments-to-end-poverty/\" title=\"Investments to End Poverty\">Investments to End Poverty report.</a>) \u00a0The CPR authors analyse data on Ugandan poverty, mainly from national household surveys (taken in 2005/6 and updated with a smaller sample in 2010). \u00a0The following findings stood out for me:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chronic poverty in Uganda, though it has halved since the 1990s, still persists: around one in ten households are still trapped in poverty (11.6%) and unable to meet their most basic needs. According to the graph on p6 of the CPR, <strong>about 7.5 million people</strong> are in absolute poverty in Uganda.</li>\n<li>Nearly half of all poor households are chronically poor, or in long-term, persistent poverty (48.8% in 2009/10). (For a more in-depth explanation of what constitutes \u2018chronic poverty\u2019, visit the <a href=\"http://www.chronicpoverty.org/page/about-chronic-poverty\">CPRC webpage)</a></li>\n<li>The number of \u2018insecure non-poor\u2019 individuals, those with consumption levels between the poverty line and twice the poverty line, has also increased- <strong>see below</strong>. The report calls this a \u2018new group of vulnerable people.\u201d It is certainly a group that policymakers should pay increasing attention to.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/uganda.png\"><img alt=\"uganda poverty graph\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1906 aligncenter\" height=\"284\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/uganda.png\" width=\"696\"/></a></p>\n<p><b>Economic growth will leave the poorest behind- without targeted social protection policies</b></p>\n<p>A strong message in the CPR is that the potentially positive benefits of predicted economic growth in Uganda are in danger of being offset by the country\u2019s increasing economic and social inequality. This is caused by (in part) rural-urban migration and its impacts; as well as loss of livelihoods in the agricultural sector from environmental stress and climate change.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" id=\"attachment_1904\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Uganda-market1.jpg\"><img alt=\"Credit: Adam Jones\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1904\" height=\"225\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Uganda-market1-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\"/></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Market at Kisoro.

Social protection policies can play a vital role in mitigating any impacts of economic growth on the poorest, where they are failing to benefit from it.\u00a0The report takes a detailed look at the emergence of social protection policy programmes in Uganda, and notes that Uganda is still experiencing basic challenges to implementing or targeting successful SP policies; they cite \u2018lack of political will\u201d and a number of other contributing social, political and structural factors.</p>\n<p>The foreword by the Minister of State for Gender Labour and Social Development, whose ministry leads on social protection interventions, states that more coherent policies across the Ugandan government are needed in Uganda; to sustain the impact of the welfare interventions through a more \u201cequitable distribution of resources\u201d in Ugandan society.</p>\n<p><b>Collaboration, cross-working and coherent policies</b></p>\n<p>For us at DI, the messages of the Uganda CPR will resonate as we follow post-2015 debates on what will replace the MDGs- and <a href=\"http://devinit.org/di-analyst-viewpoint-ian-townsend-ending-poverty/\" title=\"Ending poverty by 2030: A DI Analyst viewpoint\">how we finance the end of poverty by 2030</a>. The report reminds us just how urgent it is to get agreement on the priorities here. Even more importantly, it provides clear evidence that building consensus across all stakeholder groups- private sector, donors, governments, CSOs and multilateral agencies- is essential if we are to eradicate poverty by 2030. Growth-focused development strategies which are aimed at eradicating poverty, but which make no provision for those in chronic poverty (the elderly; the disabled; those in isolated rural areas with lack of access to opportunity, education and jobs; those vulnerable to climate change and disaster) could be counter-productive and remove the positive impacts of growth in the long term. This would risk putting our shared objectives, of \u201cleaving no-one behind\u201d, out of reach.</p>\n<p><i>Detailed analysis of chronic poverty in the East African region will be found in the upcoming <a href=\"http://devinit.org/east-africa-chronic-poverty-report-pipeline/\" title=\"\u2018East Africa Chronic Poverty Report\u2019 in the pipeline\">East African Chronic Poverty report</a>,</i>\u00a0<i>a collaborative effort with the CPRC and other organisations. \u00a0</i></p>\n</div>"}]
