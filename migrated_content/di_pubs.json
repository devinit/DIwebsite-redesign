The World Bank estimates that close to 40% of the eligible population in low-income\u00a0countries does not have an ID, and, according to UNICEF, in over 50 countries less than half of the population have had their births registered. Furthermore, accurate data to substantiate these estimates is hard to come by. UNICEF\u2019s data comes primarily from an ambiguous question in household surveys, and the World Bank\u2019s global dataset relies on voter registration data obtained from election results.</p>\n<p>Substantial progress is starting to be made to tackle this challenge. With the advent of affordable digital data capture many poorer countries have begun to install digital civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) and identity systems. New, more efficient, systems require new approaches to monitoring. In this paper we propose such an approach.</p>\n<p>The Africa Programme for Accelerated Improvement of CRVS (APAI-CRVS) is playing a key role in speeding up and consolidating progress towards digital legal identity for all and its Fifth Conference of African Ministers Responsible for Civil Registration will take place in Zambia 14\u201318 October 2019. DI is in Lusaka to present these proposals.</p>\n<p>Over the past two decades household surveys have played a critical role in filling data gaps in countries where there were no alternatives. Most developing countries are now growing from strength to strength in their development of national registries and administrative data. These systems, by their nature, contain a built-in monitoring framework. Data gaps are diminishing. Progress may at times be slow, but it is steady, particularly in the case of civil registration and national identity. The time is ripe for monitoring to be owned, maintained and accounted for by those responsible for securing sustainable data infrastructures. This proposal is a contribution to this necessary step.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Photo:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/unicefethiopia/35305733550\" target=\"_blank\">\u00a9UNICEF Ethiopia/2017/Michael Tsegaye</a>.\u00a0A data validation expert registers births in Baherdar, Amhara.</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "How blended finance reaches the poorest people", "authors": ["Cecilia Caio"], "format": "Discussion paper", "date": "07 Oct 2019", "description": "Our paper examines the impact blended finance can have on the poorest people, and asks how their progress can remain central to decision-making.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/blended-finance-poorest-people/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"p-t--1 p-b--1 m-b--1\" style=\"border-top:2px solid #f2f2f2; border-bottom:2px solid #f2f2f2;\">\n<div style=\"overflow:hidden;\">\n<div class=\"col-md-7\">\n<div><a class=\"btn btn--dark pdf-download\" ga-event-action=\"pdf-download\" ga-event-category=\"Download\" ga-event-label=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/how-blended-finance-reaches-the-poorest-people.pdf\" ga-on=\"click\" href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/how-blended-finance-reaches-the-poorest-people.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"how blended finance reaches the poorest people\">\n<i class=\"p ss-pdf\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0 how blended finance reaches the poorest people\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"p ss-download\"></i>\n</a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div> Modal <div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"modal pdf-popup\">\n<div class=\"modal-dialog wide\">\n<div class=\"modal-body \">\n<div>\n<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"btn-close\" href=\"#\" id=\"close-pdf-modal\">\u00d7</a>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t          Can we contact you later to ask your opinion about the publication you just downloaded?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf yes, please leave your email below.

A key trend across aid donors has been to turn to private sector actors as the source of such finance, including through innovative investment structures such as blended finance.</p>\n<p>However, this is not always being done with due consideration\u00a0of available evidence on the impact that such private sector involvement may have on sustainable development outcomes and on poverty reduction in particular. Our discussion paper assesses the theories of change put forward by 12 key blended finance actors alongside impact data and information published by 56 development finance institutions, multilateral development banks and donor agencies involved in blending, and finds that a number of gaps in logic and transparency exist. If addressed, these would enable us to demonstrate whether and why investing ODA in blending can be an effective use of aid resources.</p>\n<p>Poverty is a complex phenomenon and so eradicating it will require a wide range of actions. Blended finance can be an important tool to facilitate the positive contribution of private finance to sustainable development and poverty reduction, but before scaling up investments, the assumptions around how its impact will materialise must be addressed.</p>\n<p>Our paper recommends that in order to take the conversation forward donors should focus on a small number of fundamental questions \u2013 \u2018who benefits?\u2019, \u2018how?\u2019 and \u2018when?\u2019 \u2013 and on how existing reporting standards can be harnessed to facilitate the collection and use of the necessary data to answer them. The questions put forward in our conclusion revolve around the intended and unintended impact that investments have on the poorest and most marginalised people \u2013 thus ensuring that their progress remains at the core of ODA allocation decision-making.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/How-blended-finance-reaches-the-poorest-people.xlsx\" target=\"_blank\">Download the data</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/di-kicks-off-project-on-blended-public\u2212private-finance-for-development/\">Read more of our work on blended finance</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": null, "authors": [], "format": "Full text; Report", "date": "30 Sep 2019", "description": "The Global Humanitarian Assistance Report is produced annually to provide a leading resource for understanding humanitarian financing and related aid flows.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/global-humanitarian-assistance-report-2019/", "body": ""}, {"title": "Failing to reach the poorest: Subnational financing inequalities and health and education outcomes", "authors": [], "format": "Report", "date": "19 Sep 2019", "description": "This report from DI and ODI looks at how effectively subnational financing targets regions with the worst health and education outcomes", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/subnational-financing-inequalities-health-education-outcomes/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"p-t--1 p-b--1 m-b--1\" style=\"border-top:2px solid #f2f2f2; border-bottom:2px solid #f2f2f2;\">\n<div style=\"overflow:hidden;\">\n<div class=\"col-md-7\">\n<div><a class=\"btn btn--dark pdf-download\" ga-event-action=\"pdf-download\" ga-event-category=\"Download\" ga-event-label=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Failing-to-reach-the-poorest_Subnational-financing-inequalities-and-health-and-education-outcomes_report.pdf\" ga-on=\"click\" href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Failing-to-reach-the-poorest_Subnational-financing-inequalities-and-health-and-education-outcomes_report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Failing to reach the poorest_Subnational financing inequalities and health and education outcomes_report\">\n<i class=\"p ss-pdf\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0 Failing to reach the poorest_Subnational financing inequalities and health and education outcomes_report\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"p ss-download\"></i>\n</a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div> Modal <div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"modal pdf-popup\">\n<div class=\"modal-dialog wide\">\n<div class=\"modal-body \">\n<div>\n<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"btn-close\" href=\"#\" id=\"close-pdf-modal\">\u00d7</a>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t          Can we contact you later to ask your opinion about the publication you just downloaded?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf yes, please leave your email below.

But, as the latest <a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2019/The-Sustainable-Development-Goals-Report-2019.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">UN report on the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</a> notes, access to quality healthcare and education is not equally distributed across the world. And, as <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/refocus-oda-end-poverty-meet-sdgs/\" target=\"_blank\">previous research by DI</a> and <a href=\"https://www.odi.org/publications/11433-financing-end-extreme-poverty-2019-update\" target=\"_blank\">by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI)</a> showed, sufficient financing is not being mobilised to address these global inequalities.</p>\n<p>Previous research conducted jointly by ODI and DI found that <a href=\"https://www.odi.org/publications/11308-subnational-investment-human-capital\" target=\"_blank\">subnational financing is not well targeted on the poorest regions</a>.\u00a0Access to quality, affordable or free health services and education is vital. In some countries, the number of teachers and health workers in the very poorest areas is as much as ten times less than the national average, increasing the risk of leaving the poorest behind and continuing inequality.</p>\n<p>This paper builds on that research, assessing how well subnational financing of health and education in all 82 low- and middle-income countries (including all LDCs) targets regions with the worst health and education outcomes. Many countries do not publish sufficient recent and comprehensive data, and analysis was possible in only 16 countries.</p>\n<h4>Findings</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>There is little evidence of a progressive allocation of health and education resources by governments to the regions with the worst health and education outcomes. Instead, in most countries, the trend is for slightly less financing to be provided to areas with the worst outcomes \u2013 typically 12% below national average for health and 7% below for education. The consistency of the findings across different indicators \u2013 whether under-five or under-18 mortality, years of schooling or secondary completion rates \u2013 suggests that poor and/or inconsistent targeting is a broader problem.</li>\n<li>There is strong evidence that donors do target aid for health to regions with the worst under-five mortality rates \u2013 typically 29% higher. Results are more mixed in terms of under-18 mortality rates.</li>\n<li>There is no consistent trend in donor targeting of aid for education. There is strong positive targeting in some countries, and the reverse in others. The evidence that governments that do publish data do not target the neediest is all the more concerning as those countries that do not publish subnational expenditure data are likely to be even less concerned about targeting spending at the neediest regions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Recommendations</h4>\n<p>If we are to ensure that we leave no one behind and build human capital for all, we will need to ensure that the worst-performing regions receive consistently more, not less, resourcing. The evidence from this paper suggests that there is a clear case for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>governments and education donors to learn from why donor aid for health seems to be so much better targeted;</li>\n<li>government and education donors to commit to improve the targeting of their financial resources;</li>\n<li>at a minimum, ensuring at least equal allocation of government spending between regions, and;</li>\n<li>above-national-average spend for education aid in worst-performing regions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Better targeting on its own will not eliminate inequality.

The study sought to understand:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the current operational policies and practices related to the collection and sharing of registration data;</li>\n<li>the current initiatives towards harmonising data systems;</li>\n<li>the options for standardising, sharing, storing, monitoring and protecting data in a secure way that increases the efficiency and effectiveness of the response, minimises duplication and remains operationally relevant to the identification of needs in Somalia;</li>\n<li>and the ethical, fiduciary, reputational and legal risks associated with harmonising cash transfer programme data systems.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Key findings</h3>\n<p>There are some initiatives by humanitarian actors, donors and the Federal Government of Somalia to harmonise cash transfer programme data systems, but more effort is needed to develop an effective solution. Such a solution should aim to unlock the benefits of harmonisation \u2013 including improved aid effectiveness and better coordination and caseload planning \u2013 while navigating the privacy, security, fiduciary, legal and reputational risks that harmonisation presents.</p>\n<p>Our study identified some key challenges towards this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is limited standardisation of data fields, which hinders the establishment of interoperability.</li>\n<li>Developing data-sharing agreements that conform to the different organisation-level policies remains a significant challenge. Somalia has a weak legal framework for data protection, which has contributed in part to the development of a number of varying organisation-level data protection protocols and policies.</li>\n<li>Lack of a unique identifier to link and match datasets across databases.</li>\n<li>The politics of ownership and control over access to data prevent collaborative efforts by humanitarian agencies to harmonise data systems.</li>\n<li>The lack of a common stance among donors leads to uncoordinated efforts to harmonising data systems.</li>\n<li>Fear of the potential disruptions that harmonisation can cause to current operations of humanitarian agencies leads to resistance.</li>\n<li>There is a lack of trust in the quality of data from external sources.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Recommendations</h3>\n<p><strong>Humanitarian agencies</strong> <strong>should</strong> harmonise data fields, improve data quality, implement measures to protect personal data, obtain adequate consent to share data and establish cross-agency data sharing agreements to facilitate establishment of interoperability and sharing of data. They should also work with donors, the <a href=\"http://www.cashlearning.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Cash Learning Partnership</a>, the government and the private sector to develop a short-term identification mechanism such as an algorithm based on matching a combination of a selection of data variables to determine potential duplication in the absence of a national ID system.</p>\n<p><strong>Donors should</strong> adopt a coordinated approach to harmonising data systems, working with other actors and consortia to develop a shared vision and objective for harmonising data systems, and providing financial and technical support to humanitarian agencies towards the achievement of this. Policies should be implemented to prioritise the implementation of cash transfer programmes that use streamlined targeting, registration, distribution and monitoring and evaluation approaches, underpinned by interoperable databases, harmonised data collection tools and data-sharing agreements.</p>\n<p><strong>The Federal Government of Somalia</strong> <strong>should</strong> enact legislation to guide the protection, sharing and use of personal data in the short term, and complete the development and roll-out of a digital ID system to support effective identification and verification in cash transfer programmes in the long term.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dfid/33106643450\" target=\"_blank\">Photo</a>: World Food Programme.\u00a0A woman holds a World Food Programme e-card in Somalia, March 2017.\u00a0The e-cards, which are supported by the UK and other donors, are a secure and cost-effective means of supplying cash assistance to people in need of food.

It presents findings from a risk-sensitive review of Uganda\u2019s budget for three financial years (FYs) (2016/17\u20132018/19).</p>\n<p>Acute levels of vulnerability\u00a0associated with the heavy reliance of Uganda\u2019s economy on rain-fed subsistence agriculture makes it highly vulnerable to climate change.\u00a0Vulnerability is exacerbated by low adaptive capacity, increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, high levels of poverty, weak institutional capacity, low skills on climate change adaptability, inadequate skills in disaster management, lack of equipment for disaster management and limited financial resources.</p>\n<h3>Key findings</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>An average of Uganda Shillings (UGX) 966 billion a year was allocated to DRR from FY2016/17 to 2018/19 \u2013 this allocation constitutes 4% of Uganda\u2019s total budget for the three budget cycles.</li>\n<li>Uganda spent 0.5% of its total budget on principal DRR activities (i.e. where DRR is the\u00a0primary objective) and 3.9% on significant DRR\u00a0(i.e. where DRR is the secondary objective) activities during the three FYs.</li>\n<li>Only six sectors had \u2018principal\u2019 DRR investments. The Disaster Preparedness and Refugee Management programme under the Office of the Prime Minister in the public management sector houses most of Uganda\u2019s principal DRR programmes and projects. These include refugee management, humanitarian assistance, disaster preparedness and management and resettlement of disaster victims. They were allocated the largest share (35.9%) of total principal DRR investments over the three FYs.</li>\n<li>Activities and projects under the water and environment sector were allocated the second-largest share (32.8%) of total principal DRR investment over the three FYs.</li>\n<li>Most DRR investments over the three FYs were domestically financed,</li>\n<li>Of disaster risk categories, mitigation and prevention activities were allocated the largest share of DRR investments, followed by preparedness and recovery. Response activities received the smallest share of total DRR investments over the three FYs.</li>\n<li>Overall, Uganda allocated on average 64% of total principal DRR investment on mitigation and prevention, 4% on preparedness, 6% on response and relief activities, and 26% on recovery activities.</li>\n<li>Uganda\u2019s principal DRR budget over the three FYs has been aligned mainly to enhancing disaster preparedness (Sendai Priority 4) and building resilience (Sendai Priority 3). Little attention has been given to developing disaster risk knowledge (Sendai Priority 1) and strengthening disaster risk governance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Recommendations</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Investing in DRR is investing in development. Investment in mitigation and prevention and disaster preparedness reduces vulnerabilities and risk exposure. Investment in resilience to ensure sustainable development also reduces disaster risk. Given that few sectors (6 of 18) invest in DRR as a primary objective, there is need to create more budget lines in other sectors, and to mainstream primary DRR budget lines in existing offices.</li>\n<li>There is also need to spread allocation across all four components of the DRR risk categories to ensure appropriate disaster risk management. To better design DRR and development initiatives, the country needs to increase public sending on managing disaster risk through better planning and coordination within and across sectors (Sendai Priority 2) and by building disaster risk knowledge through pre-disaster risk assessment (Sendai Priority 1).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Photo:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/climatecentre/22459277973\" target=\"_blank\">Denis Onyodi/Uganda Red Cross Climate Centre</a>: In a ground-breaking humanitarian action triggered by a forecast of flood risk, the Uganda Red Cross distributed just under 5,000 preparedness items to communities in Kapelebyong sub-county, some 300 km north-east of the capital, Kampala, in November 2015.</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Kenya\u2019s 2019/20 budget and the big four agenda: a pro poor analysis", "authors": ["Boniface Owino"], "format": "Report", "date": "01 Aug 2019", "description": "We present a detailed analysis of the Kenya budget for the 2019/20 financial year and how it might impact the poorest people.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/kenyas-201920-budget-and-the-big-four-agenda-a-pro-poor-analysis/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"p-t--1 p-b--1 m-b--1\" style=\"border-top:2px solid #f2f2f2; border-bottom:2px solid #f2f2f2;\">\n<div style=\"overflow:hidden;\">\n<div class=\"col-md-7\">\n<div><a class=\"btn btn--dark pdf-download\" ga-event-action=\"pdf-download\" ga-event-category=\"Download\" ga-event-label=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Report_Kenya\u2019s-2019-20-budget-and-the-big-four-agenda-a-pro-poor-analysis.pdf\" ga-on=\"click\" href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Report_Kenya\u2019s-2019-20-budget-and-the-big-four-agenda-a-pro-poor-analysis.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Report_Kenya\u2019s 2019-20 budget and the big four agenda - a pro poor analysis\">\n<i class=\"p ss-pdf\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0 Report_Kenya\u2019s 2019-20 budget and the big four agenda - a pro poor analysis\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"p ss-download\"></i>\n</a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div> Modal <div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"modal pdf-popup\">\n<div class=\"modal-dialog wide\">\n<div class=\"modal-body \">\n<div>\n<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"btn-close\" href=\"#\" id=\"close-pdf-modal\">\u00d7</a>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t          Can we contact you later to ask your opinion about the publication you just downloaded?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf yes, please leave your email below.

The analysis focuses on resource allocations to the big four development agenda priority areas \u2013 universal healthcare, affordable housing, manufacturing and food security. The analysis also covers resource allocation to education and social protection programmes.</p>\n<h3>Key findings</h3>\n<p>While resource allocation to some pro-poor programmes has increased, there are significant funding gaps that should be addressed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Health sector:</strong> The health sector has received KES 36.67 billion, representing only 73% of the required resources. The Health Policy, Standards and Regulations programme, which is to help achieve universal health coverage, has been allocated KES 16.1 billion in the financial year (FY) 2019/20; while this represents a 31% increase from FY2018/19, it translates to only 57% of the resources required.</li>\n<li><strong>Housing:</strong> The Delivery of Affordable and Social Housing Units sub-programme has received KES 7 billion to deliver affordable housing units. This funding will go to the Kenya Mortgage Finance Company to facilitate access to affordable housing. The company has received a further KES 1.2 billion from banks and savings and credit cooperatives, with KES 400 million expected from the International Finance Corporation and Shelter Afrique.</li>\n<li><strong>Manufacturing: </strong>The Promotion of Industrial Development and Investment sub-programme, which falls in the State Department for Industrialisation and Enterprise Development, has been allocated KES 1.1 billion. This is only 12% of the resources required.</li>\n<li><strong>Food security:</strong> In FY2018/19 allocations to food security initiatives totalled KES 9.3 billion; this declined to KES 7.3 billion in FY2019/20. In FY2018/19 the food security initiatives received 100% of total resource required; the proportion received declined in FY2019/20 to 40%, despite the risk of food security situation worsening due to poor rains.</li>\n<li><strong>Education:</strong> Free Primary Education and Free Day Secondary Education programmes received 77% and 47% of the required development resources respectively. The Health and Nutrition programme (which includes school feeding) received 74% of required total resources.</li>\n<li><strong>Social protection:</strong> Allocation of resource to social protection for vulnerable groups increased from KES 11.3 billion in FY2018/19 to KES 13.4 billion in FY2019/20. In FY2019/20 cash transfers to orphans and vulnerable children, including those outside households, amounted to KES 6.6 billion, while transfers to elderly people totalled KES 5.1 billion. This allocation is similar to that in FY2018/19.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Key recommendations</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The government needs to increase the resource mobilisation efforts that will enable adequate funding for the health, education, manufacturing, food security and housing sectors.</li>\n<li>To ensure data quality, data from the various budget documents published by the National Treasury, the Office of Controller of Budget and county governments should be harmonised.</li>\n<li>Coordination between the county and national governments should be improved through the Intergovernmental Relations Technical Committee, which is mandated to handle such frameworks. Further legislation is needed to address the gap created by the lack of clarity on the role played by national and county governments in the industrialisation agenda.</li>\n<li>The establishment of the Public Investment Management Unit should also be backed by legislation and adequate resource through the national budget and should include accountability and enforcement clauses, which will ensure effective implementation of public investment programmes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a class=\"pdf-download\" href=\"http://devinit.org/post/pro-poor-analysis-kenyas-201819-budget-estimates/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pro-poor-analysis-of-the-2018-19-Uganda-budget.pdf\">Read our report on Kenya\u2019s budget for\u00a0last financial year</a></p>\n<p>Photo:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/dfid/4127649201\" target=\"_blank\">DFID International Development Research Centre/Thomas Omondi</a>.\u00a0Thomas Osore Omulako, 74, a rainmaker in the Nganyi community shows his maize farm.

An overview of poverty, expenditure, revenue, financing and debt is also provided. Uganda\u2019s Second National Development Plan (NDP II) sets the investment priorities for delivering key development goals and targets. Uganda\u2019s PAF is earmarked for priority programmes that directly alleviate poverty.</p>\n<h3><strong>Key findings</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Revenues and expenditures.</strong> While expenditures have grown at an average rate of 18% over the last five years, revenue has grown at an average rate of 15.7% in the same period. Uganda\u2019s resource envelope is largely driven by tax revenue, which has been growing at an average rate of 14% per year since FY2016/17. Uganda\u2019s expenditure\u2013GDP ratio, at 27%, is below the 21% target set out in the NDP II. External debt constitutes 74% of total debt against a target of 29%.</p>\n<p><strong>Focus on infrastructure.</strong> Uganda\u2019s spending under the PAF in FY2019/20 has largely focused on infrastructure development; this is important since infrastructure development is an essential driver for growth across all sectors. Education and health are also prioritised, as evident in their higher proportion of PAF allocation in comparison to other sectors. Reducing poverty though agriculture seems to require much more attention than has been given: PAF expenditure on agriculture is much lower than other major sectors (7%), yet agriculture remains the mainstay of Uganda\u2019s economy.</p>\n<p><strong>Debt sustainability. </strong>Uganda\u2019s debt portfolio is growing, and there are concerns about the increase. The budget deficit and therefore financing have grown in absolute terms from UGX 4.5 trillion in FY2015/16 to 10.1 trillion in FY2019/20. Consequently, interest payments are made from recurrent expenditure, and (on average, for FY2015/16\u20132019/20) constitute 21% of this. Increasing debt implies that more money will be allocated to interest payments, and less on service delivery and development spending. Also, increased borrowing from domestic sources crowds out investment in the private sector, affecting employment and output.</p>\n<p><strong>Service-delivery outcomes of expenditure allocation. </strong>Expenditure allocations and actual spending cannot be easily linked and aligned to social outcomes, as with the case of health or education. The most recent data available is often 2\u20134 years old. Even though a large proportion of the health allocation from the PAF is spent on pharmaceuticals and medical supplies (25% of total health PAF allocation), 77% of households perceive the service delivery in relation to drug quality as poor or only fair. Likewise, staff responsiveness to health needs of households when seeking treatment was found to be wanting, with 54% ranking their services as fair or poor.</p>\n<h3>Key recommendations</h3>\n<p>Fairly low priority is given to the social protection and agriculture sectors and their subsequent PAF expenditure allocation. To minimise the risk of increase in vulnerable populations, the government should allocate adequate funds for social protection to reduce vulnerability risks of the population.</p>\n<p>Government would have to increase domestic resource mobilisation through expanding the tax base and, more importantly, increase efficiency in use of public resources through effectively sealing corruption loopholes in order to reduce the reliance on external financing and public debt.</p>\n<p>The PAF has mixed outcomes based on anecdotal evidence; there is need for further impact analysis of the PAF interventions to establish if they support the poorest people. The government can, through UBOS, initiate biennial household data collection that can facilitate more accurate budgetary impact analysis.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pro-poor-analysis-of-the-2018-19-Uganda-budget.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Read our report on Uganda\u2019s budget for\u00a0last financial year</a></p>\n<p>Workers in Kampala, Uganda.

It also suggests key lessons and highlights questions arising from these.</p>\n<p>Read our briefing: <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/briefing-key-trends-global-humanitarian-assistance-2019/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Key trends in global humanitarian assistance 2019</em></a></p>\n<p>Listen to our webinar: <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/emerging-trends-development-finance-mean-crisis-actors/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>What do emerging trends in development finance mean for crisis actors?</em></a></p>\n<p>Photo: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/un_photo/35200567271/in/photolist-VCy7hg-VCy7fH-VQ2Vbv-VCy7dP-Uvaomr-VQ2Vai-qtwTDQ-nRrvja-nRAnQf-SBTFFp-igxz6A-V4txJu-nHbfAU-dqdxgc-dqcNxD-dcQA8Y-W2JdjH-UHBiub-qvhFvj-TjM9Ky-28GYMmp-VHPzmb-dCKpQU-fHZec3-fzXBa8-qRKe7C-UoDZPD-WG7ddJ-ggdn9z-raGJZG-TeF74R-UgyBZq-URELSA-DwKkQW-UPE8xX-V5Fjri-e3eG8s-kfNVfz-Uqvjcf-UD9zyK-UaWuWj-moL7AF-V67QZE-USkd9s-raHGp1-Vt3EW9-ew2LBM-fKjPyQ-fHZeoj-fHZe1s\" target=\"_blank\">UN Photo/Sahem Rababah</a>\u00a0A view of the Zaatari Refugee Camp in Jordan, where nearly 80,000 Syrian refugees are living</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Closing the gap: priorities for the High-level Political Forum 2019", "authors": ["Amy Dodd", "Carolyn Culey", "Dan Walton", "Daniel Coppard"], "format": "Briefing", "date": "10 Jul 2019", "description": "Ahead of HLPF 2019, we present evidence the poorest people are being left behind, and look at how we can close the gap between them and everyone else.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/closing-gap-priorities-high-level-political-forum-2019/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"><p>Ahead of discussions at the 2019 High-level Political Forum in July, this briefing presents evidence to show that progress has not been sufficient to meet the ambitions of Agenda 2030 \u2013 shining a light on how the poorest people are being left behind, and what we can do to close the gap.</p>\n</div><div class=\"p-t--1 p-b--1 m-b--1\" style=\"border-top:2px solid #f2f2f2; border-bottom:2px solid #f2f2f2;\">\n<div style=\"overflow:hidden;\">\n<div class=\"col-md-7\">\n<div><a class=\"btn btn--dark pdf-download\" ga-event-action=\"pdf-download\" ga-event-category=\"Download\" ga-event-label=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/briefing_closing-the-gap-priorities-for-the-High-level-Political-Forum-2019.pdf\" ga-on=\"click\" href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/briefing_closing-the-gap-priorities-for-the-High-level-Political-Forum-2019.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"briefing_closing the gap - priorities for the High-level Political Forum 2019\">\n<i class=\"p ss-pdf\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0 briefing_closing the gap - priorities for the High-level Political Forum 2019\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"p ss-download\"></i>\n</a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div> Modal <div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"modal pdf-popup\">\n<div class=\"modal-dialog wide\">\n<div class=\"modal-body \">\n<div>\n<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"btn-close\" href=\"#\" id=\"close-pdf-modal\">\u00d7</a>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t          Can we contact you later to ask your opinion about the publication you just downloaded?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf yes, please leave your email below.

While the theme of this year\u2019s forum is Empowering people and ensuring inclusiveness and equality, our data shows that the income gap between the poorest 20% of people and the rest has been growing, both globally and in most countries. Although there is progress at an aggregate level, people are being left behind \u2013 excluded from progress as a result of their poverty, location or aspects of their identity that contribute to their marginalisation. Despite a pledge to reach those furthest behind first, the very poorest, who are starting from a very low baseline, have seen little progress over the past 15 years.</p>\n<p>The message is clear \u2013 if we are serious about ending extreme poverty and reducing inequality, we need to be equally serious about closing the gap and raising the income and living standards of the poorest people. We need to target vital public and concessional finance much more effectively to where it is most needed. And we need better data to identify those being left behind, starting with a commitment to ensure that everyone is counted.</p>\n<h3>Figure 1: the income gap between the poorest\u00a020% of people and everyone else has been growing</h3>\n<p>Despite the commitment of SDG 10 to reduce inequality, the daily income gap\u00a0between the poorest 20% of the global population and the rest has been growing, and\u00a0on current projections, will continue to do so. Those who are furthest behind, living at\u00a0the lowest recorded level of poverty, have seen very little progress in the last 15 years.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/figure-1-the-income-gap-between-the-poorest-20-of-people-and-everyone-else-has-been-growing/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-18803\" height=\"667\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1556px) 100vw, 1556px\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Figure-1-The-income-gap-between-the-poorest-20-of-people-and-everyone-else-has-been-growing.jpg\" srcset=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Figure-1-The-income-gap-between-the-poorest-20-of-people-and-everyone-else-has-been-growing.jpg 1556w, http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Figure-1-The-income-gap-between-the-poorest-20-of-people-and-everyone-else-has-been-growing-768x329.jpg 768w\" width=\"1556\"/></a></p>\n<p><em>Source: Development\u00a0Initiatives calculations based on World Bank PovcalNet.</em><br/>\n<em>Notes: The P20 is the poorest 20% of people.

Among the 2019 VNR\u00a0countries, the gap is growing in all high income countries, all but one upper middle income country, 77% of lower middle income countries and all but one low income country.</p>\n<h3>Figure 2: there is also a growing gap between the poorest\u00a020% of people and the rest on some other key indicators, while on others the gap remains broadly the same</h3>\n<p>Poverty is multidimensional, and the state of the poorest 20% of people is low across\u00a0many indicators. On some indicators, the rate of progress of the poorest 20% is slower than the rest of the population, so the gap is widening. On other indicators, the gap\u00a0remains broadly the same. Within the poorest 20%, some people are even more disadvantaged, as disaggregation by sex in Figure 2 clearly shows.</p>\n<h4>Despite progress in the share of the population\u00a0aged over 21 who have completed at least secondary\u00a0education, the gap between the poorest 20% of people\u00a0and the rest is growing.

The UK, one of the wealthiest countries\u00a0submitting a VNR this year, was able to report against\u00a074% of 244 SDG indicators, but notes that: \u201cgaps remain,\u00a0particularly concerning the extent to which data can\u00a0currently be disaggregated, which can make it difficult\u00a0to identify those most at risk of being left behind.\u201d</p>\n<p>This puts the data challenge faced by the poorest countries\u00a0into perspective. As the VNR submitted by the Philippines\u00a0notes \u201cMonitoring of the SDGs presents huge challenges\u00a0for the entire Philippines Statistical System and its respective\u00a0counterparts in UN member states, particularly with respect\u00a0to data gaps, including insufficient data granularity which limits the country\u2019s ability to monitor the progress of the\u00a0ethical imperative of leaving no one behind.\u201d</p>\n<p>Countries draw on a variety of data sources in their VNRs.\u00a0Rather than counting everyone, datasets are often based on household surveys, which by their very definition\u00a0miss out populations living in institutions or without fixed\u00a0abodes and tend to exclude those living in remote or insecure regions. This means significant proportions\u00a0of the poorest and most vulnerable people who are\u00a0most likely to be left behind are invisible. Surveys also often lack the sample size to provide comprehensive and robust disaggregation by specific identities or small\u00a0geographic areas as well as masking disparities in the household. Yet this data is vital if we are to ensure that everyone is included in progress.</p>\n<p>Our analysis of the available global data (Figure 2) has\u00a0clearly shown that within the poorest 20%, some groups are more disadvantaged than others. As the VNR from\u00a0Bosnia and Herzegovina notes \u201cIt is important to look beyond averages and identify who is left behind, where\u00a0they are, why they are being left behind and what they\u00a0need in order to advance and enjoy the same quality\u00a0of life as the majority of the population.\u201d</p>\n<h3>Recommendations</h3>\n<p>Our data analysis alongside evidence from the VNRs\u00a0confirms that urgent action is needed to close the\u00a0growing gap between the poorest people and the\u00a0rest, and to raise the incomes and living standards\u00a0of those who are furthest behind. Unless deliberate\u00a0action is taken, millions of people will be excluded\u00a0from global progress, putting the SDGs at considerable\u00a0risk. As governments meet in New York for the July\u00a0High-level Political Forum, we propose the following\u00a0agenda for action:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Invest in comprehensive, sustainable and\u00a0interoperable civil registration and administrative\u00a0data systems to ensure everyone is counted and\u00a0all populations are visible in official data, to identify\u00a0and monitor the progress of those being left behind.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>2.

Limited access to resources among the poorest people can exacerbate vulnerability to crisis, while experiencing crisis can draw people further into poverty. In 2018, countries which were the subject of humanitarian appeals for two or more consecutive years were home to 9% of the global population. Yet they accommodated just over a fifth (21%) of the global population in poverty, living on less than $3.20 per day, and a third of the global population in extreme poverty (33%), living on less than $1.90 per day. This data supports other evidence highlighting the trend that poverty is increasingly concentrated in crisis contexts.</p>\n<p>Domestic governments should be the primary responders to crisis, using their own revenues, with international humanitarian assistance complementing where necessary. Yet, in countries with consecutive humanitarian appeals, non-grant government revenue accounted for only 58% of all available resources in 2017, compared with 75% for other developing countries. Resourcing and coordinating humanitarian and development responses to crisis, and to poverty in crisis contexts, is therefore vital.</p>\n<p>International humanitarian assistance remains a critical resource for meeting the needs of people affected by crisis. In 2018, international humanitarian assistance continued a five-year trend of growth; while the pace of growth has slowed, rising by just 1% from 2017 to an estimated US$28.9 billion, there has been an estimated increase of 30% (US$6.7 billion) since 2014.</p>\n<p>In aggregate, contributions of international humanitarian assistance from governments and EU institutions grew by US$0.7 billion from 2017 to US$22.6 billion in 2018. Among the 20 largest contributors, increases were made by seven governments (three increasing by more than 10%), with 13 reducing the volume of assistance provided (eight by more than 10%). The overall growth in international humanitarian assistance was driven by increased contributions from two countries in the Middle East and North of Sahara region. The United Arab Emirates provided US$2 billion of assistance in 2018, an increase of US$1.7 billion from 2017, while Saudi Arabia contributed US$1.3 billion, a rise of US$806 million. In contrast, aggregated contributions by European and North and Central American governments decreased. These were down by US$1.0 billion and US$446 million, respectively.</p>\n<p>International humanitarian assistance continued to be concentrated in a small number of crises. In 2017, 10 countries accounted for 63% of all country-allocable humanitarian assistance. Syria, Yemen and South Sudan received almost half of the assistance to these 10 countries (30% of total country-allocable humanitarian assistance). Of the assistance directed to the 10 largest recipients, 59% went to countries in the Middle East and North of Sahara region, with 34% flowing to countries in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>\n<p>The majority of direct government funding for international humanitarian assistance (64%) was channelled to multilateral agencies in 2017, increasing from 60% in 2016. Conversely, private donors provided most (85%) of their assistance to NGOs. Funding to NGOs as a proportion of total international humanitarian assistance increased slightly, from 33% in 2016 to 34% in 2017.</p>\n<h3>The<em> Global Humanitarian Assistance Report 2019</em></h3>\n<p>The<a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/global-humanitarian-assistance-report-2019/\" target=\"_blank\"><em> Global Humanitarian Assistance Report 2019</em></a>\u00a0(published\u00a0by Development Initiatives in September)\u00a0built on this analysis,\u00a0presenting the most comprehensive assessment of the complex\u00a0and evolving financing landscape.

This paper summarises the key lessons drawn from a study that examined how different people responded to and survived the recurrent shocks during the 2011\u20132016 period; the drivers of marginalisation or exclusion and how these are maintained; the influence that external actors had on the coping strategies used by different communities; and the apparent effectiveness of chosen strategies. The study sought to understand how livelihood and coping strategies are changing as a result of the frequency and severity of local conditions in Somalia, and local community perspectives on vulnerability and livelihood objectives.

County governments, as the first point of contact with climate-affected populations, play a pivotal role in managing climate change investment in Kenya.</p>\n<p>This report systematically screens four Kenya county budgets for the period 2016/17 to 2018/19 to measure the progress being made in climate change investment goals. The report focuses on Kenya\u2019s National Climate Change Action Plan\u2019s stated priority aim: the use of adaptation and mitigation targets to facilitate achievements in addressing subnational vulnerability to climate change.

Annual investment in climate change on average amounts to KES 614.7 million in Kisumu, KES 528.7 million in Baringo, KES 417.1 million in West Pokot and KES 269.5 million in Laikipia.</li>\n<li>Over two-thirds of investment in climate change interventions is on adaptation. These allocations are aligned to the country\u2019s focus, which as in many African countries, prioritises climate change adaptation over mitigation measures.</li>\n<li>Investment in forestry and alternative energy sources are the main mitigation strategies in the four counties. However, better enforcement of forestry legislation and adequate funding for alternative energy interventions is required to support progress in implementation of forestry and alternative energy projects.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Report recommendations</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>County level finance support mechanisms</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>County climate change funds (CCCFs) should be established to provide a reliable mechanism for financing priority climate change actions.

Losses resulting from these disasters can be economic, environmental and social, and reduce the coping abilities of the affected population and increase vulnerability to recurring disasters. Tracking subnational government investments in disaster risk reduction in Kenya\u00a0is\u00a0essential to minimise losses from future disasters and promote sustainable development.</p>\n<p>This report assesses the level of investment in disaster risk reduction (DRR) programmes in four counties in Kenya for the periods of 2016/17 to 2018/19 to evaluate the extent to which programme budgets are aligned to DRR objectives. We have based our analysis on county budget documents (2016/17\u20132018/19) to evaluate the extent to which programme budgets are aligned to DRR objectives. A summary of the report <a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Briefing_Tracking-subnational-government-investments-in-disaster-risk-reduction-in-Kenya.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">is available here</a>.</p>\n<h3><strong>Key findings</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Laikipia is the only county of the four considered, where the DRR coordinating office is not anchored in the respective governor\u2019s office. Placing DRR coordination function at the highest level of power elevates its visibility and allows disaster risk management to be positioned as a priority.</li>\n<li>At the county level, timely and reliable data on vulnerabilities to disaster risk that are driven by poverty and climate change is limited; and more so, the information that links these elements.</li>\n<li>Kisumu county has the highest number of departments with DRR-principal spending (where DRR is a primary objective of that spending). The county also has the highest direct DRR spending. This might be because of the deliberate effort the county, particularly Kisumu city, has been making towards DRR, including being the pioneer in localising <a href=\"https://www.unisdr.org/we/coordinate/sendai-framework\" target=\"_blank\">Sendai Framework</a> indicators; as well as being part of the global \u2018<a href=\"https://www.unisdr.org/we/campaign/cities\" target=\"_blank\">Making Cities Resilient</a>\u2019 campaign.</li>\n<li>The four counties invested a total of KES 6.4 billion on DRR between financial years 2016/17 and 2018/19. Baringo had the highest investment (KES 1.9 billion), followed by Kisumu and West Pokot (KES 1.7 billion each) and Laikipia (KES 1.1 billion).</li>\n<li>Counties spend the bulk of their DRR-principal funding on disaster response, preparedness or disaster prevention and mitigation. DRR-significant investment (where DRR is a secondary objective of that spending) is directed towards development and rehabilitation of roads, provision of water and preventive and promotive health care services.</li>\n<li>The share of allocations to DRR-principal programmes in respective total county budgets is less or equal to 2%. Such programmes also take less than a quarter of total marked DRR budget (except in Kisumu); while the rest goes to programmatic activities that consider DRR as a secondary objective (\u2018Significant\u2019) in all the counties.</li>\n<li>Mainstreaming of DRR investment is not limited to a small number of departments. Most DRR-principal investments are made by the office responsible for disaster risk management. DRR-significant investments are made mainly in water, roads and health departments.</li>\n<li>By aligning the counties\u2019 budgets to the Sendai Framework\u2019s priorities, the OECD marker finds DRR-principal allocations towards building disaster risk knowledge (Priority 1) only in Kisumu county. DRR-principal sub-programmes are aligned mainly to disaster response (Priority 4) in Laikipia and Kisumu while in West Pokot and Baringo the focus of DRR-principal funding is on building resilience (Priority 3). As expected, marked DRR-significant investment prioritises building resilience (Priority 3) in all counties. This is expected given that DRR-significant investment by its nature is development oriented.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Recommendations</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>There is a need to <strong>mainstream DRR budget in more institutions</strong>. There is an opportunity to involve more institutions in DRR budgeting given that disaster risk management is coordinated from the governor\u2019s office in the three counties.</li>\n<li>Counties need to <strong>make deliberate efforts to understand disaster risk</strong> (Priority 1 of Sendai Framework). Assessment and regular monitoring of the vulnerability of lives and livelihoods should be carried out to make informed planning and resource allocation. Such information should be kept at a central repository accessible by all government institutions.</li>\n<li>To make a conclusive recommendation on the DRR investment gap, there is a <strong>need to assess investment requirements for DRR by county</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For information about subnational investments that address vulnerability to\u00a0climate change, read our report<a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/tracking-subnational-government-investments-climate-change-mitigation-adaptation-kenya/\" target=\"_blank\"> \u2018Tracking subnational government investments in climate change mitigation and adaptation in Kenya\u2019</a>.</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Progress report 2018", "authors": [], "format": "Report", "date": "10 May 2019", "description": "Our 2018 progress report summarises the action we have taken in the last year to work towards our 2016-2020 Organisational Strategy.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/progress-report-2018/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"p-t--1 p-b--1 m-b--1\" style=\"border-top:2px solid #f2f2f2; border-bottom:2px solid #f2f2f2;\">\n<div style=\"overflow:hidden;\">\n<div class=\"col-md-7\">\n<div><a class=\"btn btn--dark pdf-download\" ga-event-action=\"pdf-download\" ga-event-category=\"Download\" ga-event-label=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Progress-report-2018.pdf\" ga-on=\"click\" href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Progress-report-2018.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Progress report 2018\">\n<i class=\"p ss-pdf\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0 Progress report 2018\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"p ss-download\"></i>\n</a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div> Modal <div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"modal pdf-popup\">\n<div class=\"modal-dialog wide\">\n<div class=\"modal-body \">\n<div>\n<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"btn-close\" href=\"#\" id=\"close-pdf-modal\">\u00d7</a>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t          Can we contact you later to ask your opinion about the publication you just downloaded?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf yes, please leave your email below.

Building people\u2019s wellbeing and boosting their economic potential will equip present and future generations to progress, realise their aspirations and prosper. But investments from donors and governments in human capital are not sufficiently targeting the countries and subnational regions where poverty is the highest. Leaving no one behind will require addressing inequalities <em>within</em> as well as <em>between</em> countries.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/resource-documents/12663.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">This report</a> looks at how effectively subnational financing from donors and governments targets poverty. Researched in partnership by <a href=\"https://www.odi.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Overseas Development Institute</a> (ODI) and Development Initiatives (DI), it reviews subnational spending, by both governments and donors, on health and education. The analysis of the 82 poorest countries \u2013 that is all LDCs (Least Developed Countries), LICs (Low-Income Countries) and LMICs (Lower-Middle Income Countries) \u2013 aims to improve understanding of health and education needs at the subnational level and interrogate how effectively resource allocation is meeting these needs among the poorest and most vulnerable people.</p>\n<h3>Key findings</h3>\n<h4>Subnational targeting of health and education spending</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>On average, poorer regions receive less government funding than wealthier ones. This is true for both education and health with the difference clearer for education; on average, poorer regions receive 15% less than the national average for education.</li>\n<li>On average, poorer regions receive the same level of donor support in education as the national average. In the nine countries where data is available, there is a spread of allocations with poorer regions receiving less in five and more in four.</li>\n<li>On average, poorer regions receive a slightly higher level of donor support for health than the national average.</li>\n<li>Data on how finance is allocated at the subnational level is markedly lacking</li>\n<li>Only one in\u00a0seven countries publishes adequate budget data and only one in eleven publishes adequate aid data.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>International and national targeting of health and education spending</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>At a global level, only a third of all aid goes to the LDCs, way below the half that is needed to support the investment needs for the two key sectors for human capital: education and health. There is clear scope for improvement with the best donors eight times more efficient than the worst at targeting those in greatest financial need.<b></b></li>\n<li>At a national level, none of the LDCs \u2013 and none of the other low-income and lower-middle income countries (LICs and LMICs) \u2013 meet the internationally recognised targets for the share of their domestic resources that is spent on education and health (UNESCO, 2015 and Abuja Declaration, 2001), although some LICs do manage to achieve 75%.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Recommendations</h3>\n<h4>Improve targeting</h4>\n<p>National governments should commit to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>increasing the share of taxes spent on health and education from an average of two-thirds to a minimum of three-quarters of the internationally recognised spending targets for health and education;</li>\n<li>ensuring the poorest regions receive at least the same health and education funding as the national average and assessing what funding is necessary in addition to this.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Donors should commit to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>increasing ODA to LDCs from one-third to a minimum of half of total ODA;</li>\n<li>providing the poorest subnational regions with greater per-person spend than the national average, while recognising the need to address inequalities within regions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Increase transparency</h4>\n<p>National governments should:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>publish the subnational financial data they have;</li>\n<li>at least include information on the number of teachers and health workers at subnational level in the national budget documents.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Donors \u2013 especially the five largest in terms of ODA spend \u2013 should:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>disaggregate their information on spending subnationally and ensure this data is publicly available, and reported to government, particularly in the most aid-dependent and poorest countries.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.odi.org/human-capital\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full report</a></p>\n<p>The report was authored by:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.odi.org/experts/670-marcus-manuel\">Marcus Manuel</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/people/daniel-coppard/\">Dan Coppard</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/people/amy-dodd/\">Amy Dodd</a>,\u00a0Harsh Desai,\u00a0<a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/people/richard-watts-2/\">Richard Watts</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/people/zach-christensen/\">Zach Christensen</a>\u00a0and Stephanie Manea</p>\n<p>Photo:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldbank/5321248864/in/photostream/\" target=\"_blank\">World Bank</a></p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Six ways to refocus ODA to end poverty and meet the SDGs", "authors": ["Amy Dodd", "Daniel Coppard", "Rob Tew"], "format": "Factsheet", "date": "21 Feb 2019", "description": "Reviewing worrying trends in aid allocation that need reversing to meet the SDGs and reduce the widening gap between the poorest people and the rest.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/refocus-oda-end-poverty-meet-sdgs/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"><p>2019 is a critical year to accelerate progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as the world meets for the first SDG summit later in the year and we approach five years since the goals were introduced.

It highlights six worrying trends in aid allocation that need to be reversed if the SDGs are to be met and the widening gap between the poorest people and the rest reduced. Aid remains a critical and precious resource \u2013 but much more can be done to target the countries and sectors where it can most benefit those in need; to ensure that it is delivered in the form and channelled through the partners that can achieve the greatest impact; and to align it with the priorities of the SDGs.</p>\n<p>OECD DAC members have a critical role to play in changing our trajectory. As donors, they provide some of the only additional, concessional, grant-based public money available to support development for the poorest people and countries. Addressing the six trends below is key to safeguarding this crucial role and delivering on the world\u2019s commitment to Agenda 2030.</p>\n</div><div class=\"p-t--1 p-b--1 m-b--1\" style=\"border-top:2px solid #f2f2f2; border-bottom:2px solid #f2f2f2;\">\n<div style=\"overflow:hidden;\">\n<div class=\"col-md-7\">\n<div><a class=\"btn btn--dark pdf-download\" ga-event-action=\"pdf-download\" ga-event-category=\"Download\" ga-event-label=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Six-ways-to-refocus-ODA-to-end-poverty-and-meet-the-SDGs.pdf\" ga-on=\"click\" href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Six-ways-to-refocus-ODA-to-end-poverty-and-meet-the-SDGs.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Six ways to refocus ODA to end poverty and meet the SDGs\">\n<i class=\"p ss-pdf\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0 Six ways to refocus ODA to end poverty and meet the SDGs\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"p ss-download\"></i>\n</a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div> Modal <div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"modal pdf-popup\">\n<div class=\"modal-dialog wide\">\n<div class=\"modal-body \">\n<div>\n<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"btn-close\" href=\"#\" id=\"close-pdf-modal\">\u00d7</a>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t          Can we contact you later to ask your opinion about the publication you just downloaded?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf yes, please leave your email below.

ODA to LICs increased by just 1% \u2013 it actually declined by 5% between 2010 and 2016, then rose 6% in 2017.

ODA needs to be refocused to the places it is needed most to close the widening gap between the poorest people and places and the rest of the world \u2013 in practical terms, this means accelerating ODA growth to the poorest countries.</em></p>\n<p></p></div></li><li><a aria-controls=\"accordion-1-c2\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"true\" aria-selected=\"false\" class=\"accordion-title\" id=\"accordion-1-t2\" role=\"tab\" tabindex=\"0\">The poorest countries are receiving more loans at the expense of critical grants</a><div aria-hidden=\"true\" aria-labelledby=\"accordion-1-t2\" class=\"accordion-content\" id=\"accordion-1-c2\" role=\"tabpanel\">\n<h5>Figure 2: In LDCs grants are lower than in 2010 while loans have more than doubled</h5>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-18073\" height=\"494\" sizes=\"(max-width: 799px) 100vw, 799px\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Figure-2-In-LDCs-grants-are-lower-than-in-2010-while-loans-have-more-than-doubled.png\" srcset=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Figure-2-In-LDCs-grants-are-lower-than-in-2010-while-loans-have-more-than-doubled.png 799w, http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Figure-2-In-LDCs-grants-are-lower-than-in-2010-while-loans-have-more-than-doubled-768x475.png 768w\" width=\"799\"/></p>\n<p><em>Source: Development Initiatives based on OECD DAC data.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>ODA to LDCs flatlined between 2010\u20132016 before rising by US$4.8 billion in 2017.

The International Development Association (IDA), for example, has cut its grant funding to LDCs by over US$1 billion, from US$1.7 billion to just under US$700 million since 2010. Meanwhile, its lending to LDCs increased by US$4.6 billion \u2013 most notably to Bangladesh (up by US$1 billion), Ethiopia (up by US$713 million) and Yemen, which despite ongoing conflict, received US$533 million in IDA loans in 2017, an increase of US$464 million compared to 2010.</li>\n<li>The destination of IDA lending has also shifted. In 2010, IDA gave almost US$2 billion more in loans to MICs than to LDCs, whereas in 2017 it gave over US$2 billion more in loans to LDCs than to MICs.</li>\n<li>Bilateral donors have also had a role in driving this change. France, for example, has reduced its grant funding to LDCs by US$660 million while increasing its lending to LDCs by over US$430 million since 2010.</li>\n<li>Among the DAC members who give little or no loan funding to LDCs, four donors \u2013 Netherlands, Spain, Belgium and Canada \u2013 each cut their grants to LDCs by more than US$0.5 billion.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Figure 3: IDA has moved away from lending to MICs in favour of LDCs</h5>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-18074\" height=\"493\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Figure-3-IDA-has-moved-away-from-lending-to-MICs-in-favour-of-LDCs.png\" srcset=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Figure-3-IDA-has-moved-away-from-lending-to-MICs-in-favour-of-LDCs.png 810w, http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Figure-3-IDA-has-moved-away-from-lending-to-MICs-in-favour-of-LDCs-768x467.png 768w\" width=\"810\"/></p>\n<p><em>Source: Development Initiatives based on OECD DAC data.</em></p>\n<p><em>Notes: IDA: International Development Association; LDCs: least developed countries; MICs: middle-income countries.</em></p>\n<p><em>The rise in ODA loans to the poorest and most vulnerable countries is concerning as they are the places where concessional resources are most needed and have the most impact.

Chief among these is the fact that the places and people most at risk of being left behind have access to the fewest resources, and that continuing with business as usual will not improve this scenario. The gap between the poorest people and the rest is growing \u2013 in income, in access to resources, in opportunity \u2013 and looks set to continue to widen. This, the report shows, leaves a critical role for aid to play in directly targeting poverty eradication. However, concerning trends in the way official development assistance (ODA) is allocated threaten to prevent it from doing so effectively.</p>\n<p>The OECD DAC\u2019s release of final 2017 ODA data confirms the findings of Investments to End Poverty 2018, as it shows that these worrying trends (largely) continue. It further underlines the urgency with which action needs to be taken to change trajectory if we are to end poverty by 2030 and leave no one behind. Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is possible and <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/development_initiatives/45153667002/in/album-72157699006391052/\" target=\"_blank\">there is scope for optimism</a>. However, much more needs to be done to both increase ODA levels (e.g. only five donors achieved the 0.7% target in 2017, down from six in 2016) and better target ODA to the places and sectors that need it most. For example, similarly to 2016, only a small proportion of ODA reached the countries most at risk of being left behind and no substantial change was recorded in allocations to health and social protection while education saw a small, real terms decrease.</p>\n<p>At the High-level Political Forum in 2019, as we review progress on achieving the ambitious Agenda 2030, there is an opportunity for all actors in the development community to take action to change this trajectory so that no one is left behind. DI remains committed to being an active partner in this debate, and continuing the work needed to ensure that the world achieves the SDGs, providing evidence-led research and analysis to inform better and more effective decisions about how scarce development resources can be used most effectively (on questions ranging from <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/countries-left-behind/\" target=\"_blank\">what countries are at most risk of being left behind</a> to what approaches donors can take to leverage additional <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/oda-for-domestic-revenue-mobilisation/\">domestic</a> and private sector resources for poverty eradication).</p>\n<ul class=\"accordion no-js\" id=\"accordion-1\" role=\"tablist\"><li><a aria-controls=\"accordion-1-c1\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"true\" aria-selected=\"false\" class=\"accordion-title\" id=\"accordion-1-t1\" role=\"tab\" tabindex=\"0\">Total net ODA fell in 2017 for the first time in five years</a><div aria-hidden=\"true\" aria-labelledby=\"accordion-1-t1\" class=\"accordion-content\" id=\"accordion-1-c1\" role=\"tabpanel\">\n<h5>Figure 1</h5>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-18103 size-full\" height=\"783\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1386px) 100vw, 1386px\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/fig-1.jpg\" srcset=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/fig-1.jpg 1386w, http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/fig-1-768x434.jpg 768w\" width=\"1386\"/></p>\n<p><em>Source: OECD DAC</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Net ODA fell by US$213 million \u2013 the first fall in real terms since 2012.</li>\n<li>ODA as a percentage of donors\u2019 gross national income (GNI) fell from 0.32% in 2016 to 0.31%.</li>\n<li>Debt relief fell by approximately US$1.8 billion, following a large debt write-off by Spain in 2016.</li>\n<li>In-donor refugee costs fell from an all-time high of almost US$16 billion in 2016 but remain at record high levels at over US$13.5 billion.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Table 1:\u00a0Large rises in ODA from France and Japan were offset by falls elsewhere</h5>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-18104 size-full\" height=\"726\" sizes=\"(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/table-1.jpg\" srcset=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/table-1.jpg 840w, http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/table-1-768x664.jpg 768w\" width=\"840\"/></p>\n<p><em>Source: OECD DAC </em></p>\n<p><em>Notes: Table shows top 10 bilateral donors in 2017.</em></p>\n<p></p></div></li> <li><a aria-controls=\"accordion-1-c2\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"true\" aria-selected=\"false\" class=\"accordion-title\" id=\"accordion-1-t2\" role=\"tab\" tabindex=\"0\">ODA as a percentage of GNI fell in 21 out of 29 DAC members in 2017</a><div aria-hidden=\"true\" aria-labelledby=\"accordion-1-t2\" class=\"accordion-content\" id=\"accordion-1-c2\" role=\"tabpanel\">\n<h5>Figure 2</h5>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-18115 size-full\" height=\"759\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/fig-2-1.jpg\" srcset=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/fig-2-1.jpg 1078w, http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/fig-2-1-768x541.jpg 768w\" width=\"1078\"/></p>\n<p><em>Source: OECD DAC</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Five donors achieved the 0.7% ODA-GNI target in 2017, down from six in 2016.</li>\n<li>Sweden is the most generous donor on this measure at 1.02% of GNI.</li>\n<li>The percentage of French ODA-GNI rose from 0.38% to 0.43% following a commitment to spend 0.55% by 2022.</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p></div></li> <li><a aria-controls=\"accordion-1-c3\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"true\" aria-selected=\"false\" class=\"accordion-title\" id=\"accordion-1-t3\" role=\"tab\" tabindex=\"0\">The proportion of ODA given as core multilateral funding has remained steady</a><div aria-hidden=\"true\" aria-labelledby=\"accordion-1-t3\" class=\"accordion-content\" id=\"accordion-1-c3\" role=\"tabpanel\">\n<h5>Figure 3</h5>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-18106 size-full\" height=\"754\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1334px) 100vw, 1334px\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/fig-3.jpg\" srcset=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/fig-3.jpg 1334w, http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/fig-3-768x434.jpg 768w\" width=\"1334\"/></p>\n<p><em>Source: OECD DAC</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Core multilateral funding accounted for 28% of total net ODA in 2017 \u2013 this proportion has remained consistent for the last decade.</li>\n<li>The US gives a much lower proportion of its ODA in the form of core multilateral funding than other DAC donors.

Adequate mobilisation of own-source revenue (OSR) \u2013 income generated by subnational governments from local sources in the form of taxes, charges and fees \u2013 is key to improved provision of various public goods and services to eradicate poverty and achieve development goals.</p>\n<p>Strengthening OSR mobilisation can improve fiscal autonomy through more predictable access to revenue. This would allow county governments to have greater ownership and control over their development agenda. Own-source revenue also has the potential to foster political and administrative accountability of county officials to their constituents.</p>\n<p>This report looks at the progress that has been made in strengthening OSR mobilisation in Kenya in the first five years of fiscal decentralisation, covering the period of 2013/14 to 2017/18. It identifies the counties that have made significant progress in enhancing OSR mobilisation and those that are left behind. It also considers the challenges associated with OSR mobilisation, and opportunities for improvement.</p>\n<h4>Key findings</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Several policies have been developed at the national and county level to strengthen OSR mobilisation. Nevertheless, there are gaps in the legal and policy framework that may result in counties being off-track in meeting their OSR mobilisation targets.</li>\n<li>The volume of OSR across counties is still small in volume, as is its percentage\u00a0of national gross domestic product (GDP). Its volume has been decreasing since 2016/17 and contributed less than 1% of national GDP between 2013/14 and 2017/18.</li>\n<li>Own-source revenue is concentrated in ten counties that have high levels of urbanisation and diverse economic activities. The OSR raised in these ten counties accounted for 72.8% of the total OSR raised by the 47 counties between 2013/14 and 2017/18.</li>\n<li>The share of own-source revenue in total county revenue is very small \u2013 it averaged 10.8% between 2013/14 and 2017/18 \u2013 and has been decreasing since 2015/16. Nairobi has the lowest level of fiscal dependence given that 45.3% of its total revenue for the period 2013/14 and 2017/18 came from own sources.</li>\n<li>Annual own-source revenue collection targets were largely missed in the first five years of fiscal decentralisation. In 2013/14 the 47 counties achieved 48.5% of their annual OSR target (actual OSR collected as a percentage of annual target). This increased to 67.2% in 2014/15 and 69.3% in 2015/16. However, achievement of annual OSR targets reduced to 56.4% in 2016/17. Although achievement increased to 66% in 2017/18, a lot remains to be done to attain the best practice of 95% to 100%.</li>\n<li>Mobilisation of OSR is constrained by legal, policy, institutional and technological challenges. However, there are opportunities for enhancing OSR mobilisation through automation of revenue collection, tapping into unexploited own-source revenue streams and investing in infrastructure and services aimed at attracting businesses and investment opportunities in counties.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"}, {"title": null, "authors": [], "format": "Full text; Report", "date": "11 Oct 2018", "description": "Investments to End Poverty 2018 explores how development finance is responding to the demands of the SDGs, and the action needed to realise them.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/investments-to-end-poverty-2018/", "body": ""}, {"title": "Understanding illicit financing flows in a development financing context", "authors": [], "format": "Factsheet", "date": "10 Oct 2018", "description": "It's clear that developing countries suffer from illicit financing flows - but what are they, and how can they be tackled with international cooperation?", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/understanding-illicit-financing-flows-in-a-development-financing-context/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"><p>This factsheet was authored by Maya Forstater, a visiting fellow at the Center for Global Development and a researcher and advisor on business and sustainable development.

Organised criminals, kleptocrats and large-scale tax evaders often move money into foreign jurisdictions, shopping around for places which don\u2019t ask too many questions or that offer attractive investment and consumption opportunities, and using structures and routes that make investigation more difficult. They use networks of relationships to obscure the money flows; such as a bank account in one country <a href=\"http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/reports/Laundering%20the%20Proceeds%20of%20Corruption.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">owned by a corporation in another jurisdiction, which is in turn owned by a trust in a third jurisdiction</a>[1]. International cooperation has a vital role to play in tracking, stopping and returning these flows (together with domestic law enforcement and regulators).</p>\n<p>It is clear that developing countries suffer from the effects of \u201cillicit financial flows\u201d (IFFs), and that often this money ends up in OECD member countries. Large estimates of the dollar value of such IFFs have raised awareness of the issue, and it can be intuitively attractive to think of IFFs as a negative flow of development resources resulting in a direct dollar-for-dollar reduction in resources for public and private investment in hospitals, schools, police officers, roads and bridges. However, the connection is not quite so direct, and IFFs are not so easy to measure as the commonly quoted estimates suggest.</p>\n<p></p></div></li> <li><a aria-controls=\"accordion-1-c2\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"true\" aria-selected=\"false\" class=\"accordion-title\" id=\"accordion-1-t2\" role=\"tab\" tabindex=\"0\">What are IFFs?</a><div aria-hidden=\"true\" aria-labelledby=\"accordion-1-t2\" class=\"accordion-content\" id=\"accordion-1-c2\" role=\"tabpanel\">\n<p>The Addis Ababa Action Agenda highlights addressing IFFs as part of the global framework for financing post-2015 development, together with good governance, rule of law, human rights, fundamental freedoms, equal access to fair justice systems, and measures to combat corruption.</p>\n<p>There is no single agreed definition of IFFs, but in general the concept relates to flows of money (or other assets used as stores of value) associated with crime and corruption, including tax evasion, usually with a focus on cross border flows[2]. It is closely associated with money laundering \u2013 the process of transforming profits from illegal activities and corruption into ostensibly \u2018legitimate\u2019 assets. Organised crime groups, kleptocrats and large-scale tax evaders use three main means to illicitly move assets offshore: physical cash; financial instruments and entities such as bank accounts and \u2018shell corporations\u2019; and movement of goods through the trade system.</p>\n<p>There is an ongoing debate about whether the definition of IFFs should be widened beyond \u2018dirty money\u2019 to include financial flows associated with multinational tax avoidance, which can be legal[3]. Sometimes \u2018trade misinvoicing\u2019 (whereby importers and exporters collude to misdeclare the value of shipments, a form of fraud that can be used to facilitate tax evasion or payment of bribes, or for money laundering) has been confused with the practice of transfer-pricing, which is a compliance responsibility of multinational companies for pricing transactions between their own subsidiaries. Strategic transfer pricing can result in \u2018base erosion and profit shifting\u2019 (BEPS), without necessarily breaking any rules. Updating the international tax system to prevent BEPS and to make sure it is able to tax global digital businesses is an important area for policy making and international cooperation. However, the problem of companies using the tax rules to their advantage is a different problem to the one of individuals and enterprises seeking to get away with breaking the law by hiding or obscuring financial flows.</p>\n<p></p></div></li> <li><a aria-controls=\"accordion-1-c3\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"true\" aria-selected=\"false\" class=\"accordion-title\" id=\"accordion-1-t3\" role=\"tab\" tabindex=\"0\">Are IFFs \u2018development finance in reverse\u2019?</a><div aria-hidden=\"true\" aria-labelledby=\"accordion-1-t3\" class=\"accordion-content\" id=\"accordion-1-c3\" role=\"tabpanel\">\n<p>IFFs have become closely associated with headlines such as \u2018developing countries losing $1 trillion\u2019 or \u2018Africa losing $50 billion\u2019. It is tempting to think of IFFs as a negative flow of development resources resulting in a direct dollar-for-dollar reduction in resources for hospitals, schools and roads, and for private investment. However, counting IFFs as development finance in reverse is not straight-forward for several reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>IFFs are by their nature hidden, and estimates are uncertain</strong>. The largest, and most commonly cited estimates of \u2018trade misinvoicing\u2019 based on gaps and mismatches in trade statistics are not reliable, as they can interpret innocent trade as illicit and small changes to underlying assumptions in calculations can have large implications for the resulting estimates[4]. Focusing on the areas where it is easiest to generate eye-catching (but unreliable) annual figures may divert attention away from areas such as crime and corruption \u2013 where it is harder to generate any figures at all.</li>\n<li><strong>One dollar of illicit financial flow is not the same as one dollar of harm</strong>. IFFs are not necessarily direct losses to the public purse. For example, if a trader undertakes misinvoicing for the purpose of evading export duties, the loss to the public purse is the tax evaded, not the total value of the illicit financial flow. On the other hand, the same channel could be used to conceal the transfer of stolen treasury funds, or to take side payments from a public contractor. The harm caused can be even greater than its headline value, since corruption undermines the rule of law, deters investment and corrodes the quality of public works. Similarly, IFFs related to organised crime have wide-reaching impacts on economies, institutions and people[5].</li>\n<li><strong>Corruption and crime can also generate illicit finances which flow </strong><strong>inwards</strong><strong>.</strong> Examples include political actors using an offshore account to finance campaigning or patronage at home, and criminals managing cross-border enterprises may transfer funds inwards. In the case of money moved offshore to evade taxation we cannot assume it is lost to the country as potential finance for investment, as funds can be \u2018roundtripped\u2019 back into countries. The most recent set of estimates published by Global Financial Integrity[6]\u00a0suggest that inward illicit financial flows to developing countries are almost double the level of outflows (although there is a large degree of uncertainty on these estimates on both sides).</li>\n<li><strong>Amounts recovered and returned through legal processes are often much less (and much later) than the original amounts stolen.</strong> There has been significant progress in countries cooperating to track, stop and return money. But the development impact of this may be more about demonstrating that justice cannot be avoided than raising timely finance for development. For example, it is estimated that Sani Abacha, who died over 20 years ago, stole several billion dollars during his presidency of Nigeria. Sustained efforts to return funds have resulted in almost $1 billion being returned. In smaller countries the amounts involved are in the hundreds of millions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thinking about IFFs as \u2018development finance in reverse\u2019 is intuitively attractive but encourages a vision of development as the process of filling up a leaky bucket with resources from the outside, rather than encouraging analysis of what happens \u2018inside the bucket\u2019 through the agency and institutions of people and societies. Grand corruption, organised crime and money laundering impair long-term economic growth and increase inequality, harming the welfare of entire economies. Actors in developed countries should take action to help those in developing countries that are fighting corruption, and to prevent facilitating and benefiting from these flows, but the value of jewels, designer clothes, cars, and properties amassed abroad by a few people, while obscene, is only a fraction of the development impact of opportunities that do not attract investment, markets and institutions corrupted, lives disrupted and public agencies corroded.</p>\n<p></p></div></li> <li><a aria-controls=\"accordion-1-c4\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"true\" aria-selected=\"false\" class=\"accordion-title\" id=\"accordion-1-t4\" role=\"tab\" tabindex=\"0\">International cooperation on IFFs</a><div aria-hidden=\"true\" aria-labelledby=\"accordion-1-t4\" class=\"accordion-content\" id=\"accordion-1-c4\" role=\"tabpanel\">\n<p>Developed countries can take action on IFFs in four ways: providing technical assistance; building understanding; strengthening their own anti-money laundering practices at home; and acting on specific cases through legal cooperation or sanctions. At the same time it is critical to ensure that anti-money laundering regulations do not push costs onto the poor, making it harder and more expensive for migrants to make remittances, non-profit organisations to assist in emergencies, and small and medium-sized firms to access financial services[7].</p>\n<p>International economic and financial crime has not traditionally been a priority area of work for development agencies. However, this is changing with increased focus on IFFs. The Norwegian government has championed action on IFFs through diplomacy, supporting research and civil society coalitions, and aiding capacity building on tax administration and anti-corruption in partner countries. Since 2006, the UK\u2019s Department for International Development (DFID) has assisted <a href=\"https://www.u4.no/publications/making-development-assistance-work-at-home-dfid-s-approach-to-clamping-down-on-international-bribery-and-money-laundering-in-the-uk/pdf\" target=\"_blank\">specialist police units</a> in tracing, seizing, and returning the fruits of grand corruption and to investigate bribery abroad[8], and provided technical assistance to tax authorities combatting tax evasion. At the same time a law on \u2018unexplained wealth orders\u2019 was established allowing assets to be frozen on suspicion of corruption. Germany has an inter-ministry committee on IFFs to coordinate cross-government action. It <a href=\"https://www.giz.de/en/worldwide/39748.html\" target=\"_blank\">assists authorities in countries such as Kenya and Peru to detect and trace IFFs</a> and to engage internationally to secure the return of stolen assets. Donors and international organisations have also supported country studies to better understand the channels and drivers of IFFs, for example, in Malawi and Namibia[9]; West Africa[10]; and Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Myanmar[11].</p>\n<p>It is critical that rich countries take action to avoid being safe havens for dirty money. This means fully implementing anti-money laundering commitments, expanding networks for exchange of tax information, investigating bribery and unexplained wealth, prosecuting offenders and providing protection to whistleblowers. International standards are set (and progress peer-reviewed) through the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and associated regional bodies, and the OECD Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes (the Global Forum). These bodies develop standards that many countries beyond the OECD have also signed up to, while the G20 has also adopted high-level principles on beneficial ownership of companies and trusts. But implementation remains patchy. For example, only <a href=\"https://www.transparency.org/whatwedo/publication/g20_leaders_or_laggards\" target=\"_blank\">eight G20 countries</a> (Australia, China, France, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom) require financial institutions to use independent and reliable sources to verify the beneficial owner of their customers[12]. In 2014 the OECD undertook a review of progress by OECD member countries in combatting money laundering, bribery, tax evasion, and in the return of stolen assets. It found modest progress, but significant gaps and weaknesses[13]. Since then a large number of OECD member countries have been through a further round of peer review by the Global Forum or mutual evaluation or follow up reports by the FATF. An up-to-date review of progress by the OECD would be helpful to drive a race-to-the-top in making major international economies and financial centres hostile to IFFs.</p>\n<p></p></div></li>\n<p></p></ul>\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\"></a></p>\n</div><div class=\"row--cards\" ng-if=\"post.notes\">\n<div class=\"col-md-12 card m-b--2\">\n<div class=\"card__content bg--light\">\n<h3 class=\"h3\">Notes</h3>\n<div> <p>[1] Financial Action Task Force, 2011.

Countries in fragile situations, especially countries classified as \u2018extremely fragile\u2019, also rely on ODA (particularly, <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/global-humanitarian-assistance-report-2018/\" target=\"_blank\">humanitarian aid</a>) more than other developing countries; while commercial sources of finance, despite dominating the overall landscape, have historically been relatively low.</p>\n<p></p></div></li> <li><a aria-controls=\"accordion-1-c7\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"true\" aria-selected=\"false\" class=\"accordion-title\" id=\"accordion-1-t7\" role=\"tab\" tabindex=\"0\">Note on methodology</a><div aria-hidden=\"true\" aria-labelledby=\"accordion-1-t7\" class=\"accordion-content\" id=\"accordion-1-c7\" role=\"tabpanel\">\n<p>Official flows include ODA, OOFs, official long-term debt.

It takes an in-depth look at how the budget is structured in terms of financing and resource allocation to determine whether key decisions on resource investments for 2018/19 are being made towards the goal of addressing poverty.</p>\n<p>The overall goal of the NDPII is to achieve a middle-income status by 2020 with a per capita income of US$1,033 and reduction in poverty to 14.2% among five indicators of progress towards the goal. To achieve the NDPII goal, the government laid down nine strategies including expansion of infrastructure investment, industrialisation, skills development, export-oriented growth, and harnessing the demographic dividend by ensuring a healthy, educated, skilled and economically engaged labour force.</p>\n<p>The NDPII outlines three national priority growth opportunities \u2013 agriculture, tourism, oil and gas \u2013 and two development fundamentals \u2013 infrastructure and human capital development. These are presented as having the best potential for launching Uganda onto a sustained path of growth and development.</p>\n<h4>Key findings</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The government resource envelope is estimated to increase by 26% from Uganda Shillings (UGX) 23.6 trillion in 2017/18 to UGX29.64 trillion in 2018/19. Only UGX12.74 trillion or 43.5% of the national budget will be available for service delivery, excluding debt repayments, domestic refinancing, budget and project support.</li>\n<li>Government revenue mobilisation is estimated to grow by 14% from UGX15.87 trillion in 2017/18 to UGX18.1 trillion in 2018/19.</li>\n<li>High levels of borrowing through non-concessional domestic and external sources will play a major role in financing Uganda\u2019s development budget for 2018/19. While this will help close the financing gap, it also leads to a further rise in debt as the level of non-concessional borrowing has grown from UGX202 billion in 2015/16 to a projected UGX1.53 trillion in 2018/19.</li>\n<li>Interest payments estimated at 11.2% of the 2018/19 budget remain high, constraining fiscal space.</li>\n<li>The works and transport sector remains government\u2019s highest priority in 2018/19 as government continues to scale up infrastructure development.</li>\n<li>The share of budget allocation to education and agriculture will decrease by 0.15% and 0.22% respectively. Health will increase by 1% and social development will stay the same from 2017/18 to 2018/19.</li>\n<li>Some proposals presented for 2018/19 may negatively impact the poorest people. These include a tax on mobile money transactions and an increase in fuel tax. Poor people rely on mobile money transactions as they are largely excluded from mainstream financial institutions. A tax on fuel may further drive basic commodity prices up as it directly or indirectly feeds into transactions costs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Key conclusions</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The balance of budgetary allocations does not reflect all government priorities and commitments under NDPII, as high priority is limited to the works and transport sector.</li>\n<li>Overall, there are a number of options government can pursue to follow up on its commitments to the NDPII and reduce poverty and vulnerability.</li>\n<li>Government\u2019s domestic revenue mobilisation capacity is growing but is still low compared with regional neighbours.</li>\n<li>Government will rely more on borrowing from concessional sources to finance the 2018/19 budget.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can view Uganda\u2019s latest poverty figures down to the sub-national level through our\u00a0<a href=\"http://data.devinit.org/spotlight-on-uganda\" target=\"_blank\">Spotlight on Uganda</a> platform.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pro-poor-analysis-of-the-2018-19-Uganda-budget.xlsx\" target=\"_blank\">Download the data</a></p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "How the P20 are doing in Benin", "authors": [], "format": "Discussion paper", "date": "13 Jul 2018", "description": "This report tracks the progress of the P20 in Benin - the poorest 20% of people in the country - and examines whether they are being included in growth.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/how-the-p20-are-doing-in-benin/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"p-t--1 p-b--1 m-b--1\" style=\"border-top:2px solid #f2f2f2; border-bottom:2px solid #f2f2f2;\">\n<div style=\"overflow:hidden;\">\n<div class=\"col-md-7\">\n<div><a class=\"btn btn--dark pdf-download\" ga-event-action=\"pdf-download\" ga-event-category=\"Download\" ga-event-label=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/the-P20-Initiative-\u2013-data-to-leave-no-one-behind-in-Benin.pdf\" ga-on=\"click\" href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/the-P20-Initiative-\u2013-data-to-leave-no-one-behind-in-Benin.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"the P20 Initiative \u2013 data to leave no one behind in Benin\">\n<i class=\"p ss-pdf\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0 the P20 Initiative \u2013 data to leave no one behind in Benin\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"p ss-download\"></i>\n</a></div><div><a class=\"btn btn--dark pdf-download\" ga-event-action=\"pdf-download\" ga-event-category=\"Download\" ga-event-label=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Initiative-P20-\u2013-Les-donn\u00e9es-pour-ne-laisser-personne-de-c\u00f4t\u00e9-au-B\u00e9nin.pdf\" ga-on=\"click\" href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Initiative-P20-\u2013-Les-donn\u00e9es-pour-ne-laisser-personne-de-c\u00f4t\u00e9-au-B\u00e9nin.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Initiative P20 \u2013 Les donn\u00e9es pour ne laisser personne de c\u00f4t\u00e9 au B\u00e9nin\">\n<i class=\"p ss-pdf\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0 Initiative P20 \u2013 Les donn\u00e9es pour ne laisser personne de c\u00f4t\u00e9 au B\u00e9nin\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"p ss-download\"></i>\n</a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div> Modal <div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"modal pdf-popup\">\n<div class=\"modal-dialog wide\">\n<div class=\"modal-body \">\n<div>\n<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"btn-close\" href=\"#\" id=\"close-pdf-modal\">\u00d7</a>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t          Can we contact you later to ask your opinion about the publication you just downloaded?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf yes, please leave your email below.

Progress has been uneven and, if left unchecked, will be even more so over the coming decade. It is therefore imperative to identify which people and countries are most at risk of being left behind in terms of poverty reduction in the coming decade, and prioritise investment to better facilitate progress.</p>\n<p>This report considers a range of models and measures for evaluating poverty, human development and fragility, and uses them to assess the commonality between the countries most at risk in all three fields. It finds there is a remarkable degree of commonality among the countries that are identified as performing poorly across these measures and methodologies. There is, therefore, growing consensus on the countries most at risk, meaning it is time to move from generating lists of countries to taking action based on understanding their key challenges and finance constraints. By applying a weighting to account for how severely countries are affected across the poverty, human development and fragility measures, this paper identifies an illustrative list of 30 countries being left behind as a basis for further analysis.</p>\n<p>Key findings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fourteen countries consistently appear among the poorest performers across 11 poverty models and scenarios applied by the World Bank, IMF and others. Thirteen countries sit in the bottom 30 across each of poverty, human development and fragility and vulnerability measures. A further 17 countries sit in two of the three measures. Twelve countries with the highest poverty projections also have significant fragility that threatens to set them further back.</li>\n<li>In 2013 the countries being left behind were home to 36% of people living in extreme poverty. This could rise to between 76% and 86% by 2030, depending on which poverty model is used. By 2030 the average country being left behind will have 23% of their population living in extreme poverty, compared with 3% in other developing countries.</li>\n<li>Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for the overwhelming share of countries being left behind, and most of the six which are outside of this region \u2013 Afghanistan, Haiti, Federated States of Micronesia, Papua New Guinea, Syria and Yemen \u2013 are facing significant political or environmental challenges or persistent and widespread conflict.</li>\n<li>Countries being left behind have a history of poor growth, together with a weak private sector, and some will struggle to grow in the future.</li>\n<li>The countries being left behind lack the domestic and international finance they need to tackle poverty. One study has estimated there are 11 countries that are 100 years away from being self-financing, all but one of which are countries being left behind.</li>\n<li>Official development assistance plays an important role. Low revenues and international finance for countries being left behind means that ODA has been their largest source of international finance since 2000, when the Millennium Development Goals were agreed. With an increasing array of other sources of finance able to contribute to development, ODA can be better focused where poverty is high and other investments are low.</li>\n<li>While some donors are looking to use ODA to leverage private sector finance, they should exercise caution. There is a lack of evidence that this will reduce poverty \u2013 particularly concerning its impact in different developing contexts \u2013 and a risk this could take scarce resources away from more proven ODA investments.</li>\n<li>Unless deliberate action is taken, including prioritising finance that targets the poorest people in the poorest places, millions of people will be excluded from global progress, putting the SDGs at considerable risk. This means having a better understanding of how to maximise the impact of both ODA and other types of finance in the challenging contexts in which poverty will become increasingly concentrated.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Countries-being-left-behind.xlsx\" target=\"_blank\">Download the data</a></p>\n<p><em>Report contributors: Dan Coppard, Director of Research &amp; Analysis; Zach Christensen, Senior Analyst;\u00a0Sam Ashby, Analyst Intern; and Emma Seery, independent consultant.</em></p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Data use: An overview of conceptual and practical approaches", "authors": ["Ralitza Naydenova"], "format": "Report", "date": "03 Jul 2018", "description": "We have explored conceptual and practical approaches to data use through desk research and contextualised them using DI\u2019s data use framework.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/data-use-overview-conceptual-practical-approaches/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"p-t--1 p-b--1 m-b--1\" style=\"border-top:2px solid #f2f2f2; border-bottom:2px solid #f2f2f2;\">\n<div style=\"overflow:hidden;\">\n<div class=\"col-md-7\">\n<div><a class=\"btn btn--dark pdf-download\" ga-event-action=\"pdf-download\" ga-event-category=\"Download\" ga-event-label=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/data-use-an-overview-of-conceptual-and-practical-approaches.pdf\" ga-on=\"click\" href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/data-use-an-overview-of-conceptual-and-practical-approaches.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"data use an overview of conceptual and practical approaches\">\n<i class=\"p ss-pdf\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0 data use an overview of conceptual and practical approaches\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"p ss-download\"></i>\n</a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div> Modal <div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"modal pdf-popup\">\n<div class=\"modal-dialog wide\">\n<div class=\"modal-body \">\n<div>\n<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"btn-close\" href=\"#\" id=\"close-pdf-modal\">\u00d7</a>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t          Can we contact you later to ask your opinion about the publication you just downloaded?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf yes, please leave your email below.

Firstly, through our work on poverty and resources, we provide analysis on people in poverty and the resources that can help address their needs. In both thematic areas, we also assess the quality of underlying data, advocate for its improvement and better accessibility, and contribute to making data more transparent and usable (e.g. through our work with the <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/projects/international-aid-transparency-initiative/\" target=\"_blank\">International Aid Transparency Initiative, IATI</a>).

Greater transparency will enhance accountability and decision-making and, critically, contribute to improving humanitarian effectiveness.</p>\n<p>As a first step, signatories agreed to publish timely, transparent, harmonised and open high-quality data on their humanitarian funding within two years of the World Humanitarian Summit (May 2016). The <a href=\"https://www.aidtransparency.net/\" target=\"_blank\">International Aid Transparency Initiative</a>\u00a0(IATI) Standard was identified as the basis for a shared, common standard and UN OCHA\u2019s <a href=\"https://fts.unocha.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Financial Tracking Service</a> (FTS) as the platform for reporting how humanitarian funding is allocated and used.</p>\n<p>The report provides an update on progress made in meeting the Grand Bargain commitments on greater transparency since DI\u2019s <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/baseline-report-implementing-and-monitoring-the-grand-bargain-commitment-on-transparency/\" target=\"_blank\">baseline report </a>was published in June 2017, as well as on improvements to the IATI Standard to better meet the needs of humanitarian publishers and data users. It also offers recommendations for further action by the Grand Bargain transparency workstream and the wider humanitarian community.</p>\n<h3><strong>Key findings</strong></h3>\n<p>There has been good progress by Grand Bargain organisations in publishing open data on their humanitarian financing and providing much more useful and usable data on their activities. As of 1 May 2018:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>44 of 59 Grand Bargain signatories (75%) were publishing open data using the IATI Standard. An additional seven organisations have started publishing to IATI since the baseline report was published in June 2017.</li>\n<li>Of the 44 signatories publishing open data using the IATI Standard\n<ul>\n<li>36 (82%) were publishing open data on their humanitarian activities; five more organisations (or their members or affiliates) have started publishing their humanitarian activities than a year ago.</li>\n<li>8 (18%) were providing more granular humanitarian data than previously, such as information on humanitarian response plans or clusters.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Over the last year the IATI Standard has been further developed to enable even more granular reporting on humanitarian funding. Released in February 2018, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.aidtransparency.net/news/iati-upgrade-to-version-2-03-goes-live&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1528379810154000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFLGxod32rdBl9XEn2pGNU7BYe5FQ\" target=\"_blank\">version 2.03</a> enables signatories (and other IATI publishers) to show levels of earmarking, pledges, cash-based programming and whether funding is channelled via local and national responders.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>31 organisations or 70% of the Grand Bargain signatories publishing to IATI are now using either version 2.02 or 2.03 of the IATI Standard, both of which allow for some degree of detailed humanitarian reporting. An additional 15 organisations (or their members or affiliates) have made improvements to their internal systems by upgrading to a more recent version of IATI since the baseline report of June 2017.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Being able to demonstrate efficiency savings on how organisations can use their IATI data for multiple reporting, for example via FTS and the European Commission\u2019s <a href=\"https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/hac/\" target=\"_blank\">EDRIS</a>, will be a key incentive for further progress on the Grand Bargain transparency commitments. FTS is working together with the Centre for Humanitarian Data, the IATI technical team and Development Initiatives to use IATI data on its digital platform to demonstrate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A reduction in the reporting burden for participating organisations, in support of the Grand Bargain commitment to harmonise and simplify reporting requirements.</li>\n<li>That disaggregated and open data, published to IATI, is easier to compare and faster to process than bespoke manual reporting.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>More open information on humanitarian funding is now becoming available. However, more and better data is required to meet the commitment and to help drive uptake and use.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Progress-report-1_supporting-Grand-Bargain-signatories-in-meeting-commitments-to-greater-transparency.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Download the report</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Grand-Bargain-transparency-workstream-Progress-report-June-2018.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">View an overview graphic of progress so far</a></p>\n<h3>More information</h3>\n<p>Download\u00a0<em><a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/an-introduction-to-iati-for-humanitarian-actors/\" target=\"_blank\">An introduction to IATI for humanitarian actors</a></em></p>\n<p>Download our <em><a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/baseline-report-implementing-and-monitoring-the-grand-bargain-commitment-on-transparency/\" target=\"_blank\">2017 Baseline report: Implementing and monitoring the Grand Bargain commitment on transparency </a></em></p>\n<p>Read the blog on <em><a href=\"https://centre.humdata.org/connecting-iati-and-fts-for-streamlined-humanitarian-reporting/\" target=\"_blank\">Connecting IATI and FTS for streamlined humanitarian reporting</a></em></p>\n<p>Access the <em><a href=\"http://46.101.46.6/dashboard\" target=\"_blank\">Grand Bargain Transparency Dashboard</a></em><em>,</em> a public online tool to enable signatories to track their own progress</p>\n<p>Listen to our webinar series\u00a0<em><a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/webinar-improving-humanitarian-transparency-with-iati/\" target=\"_blank\">Improving humanitarian transparency with IATI</a></em></p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Pro-poor analysis of Kenya\u2019s 2018/19 budget estimates", "authors": ["Boniface Owino"], "format": "Report", "date": "13 Jun 2018", "description": "This report analyses the 2018/19 Kenya budget estimates, providing an in-depth look at the allocations most likely to affect the poor population.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/pro-poor-analysis-kenyas-201819-budget-estimates/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"><p>This report\u00a0analyses the 2018/19 Kenya budget estimates,\u00a0providing an in-depth look at the allocations most likely to affect\u00a0the poor population.</p>\n</div><div class=\"p-t--1 p-b--1 m-b--1\" style=\"border-top:2px solid #f2f2f2; border-bottom:2px solid #f2f2f2;\">\n<div style=\"overflow:hidden;\">\n<div class=\"col-md-7\">\n<div><a class=\"btn btn--dark pdf-download\" ga-event-action=\"pdf-download\" ga-event-category=\"Download\" ga-event-label=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Report_Pro-poor-analysis-of-Kenyas-201819-budget-estimates.pdf\" ga-on=\"click\" href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Report_Pro-poor-analysis-of-Kenyas-201819-budget-estimates.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Report_Pro-poor analysis of Kenyas 201819 budget estimates\">\n<i class=\"p ss-pdf\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0 Report_Pro-poor analysis of Kenyas 201819 budget estimates\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"p ss-download\"></i>\n</a></div><div><a class=\"btn btn--dark pdf-download\" ga-event-action=\"pdf-download\" ga-event-category=\"Download\" ga-event-label=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Briefing_Pro-poor-analysis-of-Kenyas-201819-budget-estimates.pdf\" ga-on=\"click\" href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Briefing_Pro-poor-analysis-of-Kenyas-201819-budget-estimates.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Briefing_Pro-poor analysis of Kenyas 201819 budget estimates\">\n<i class=\"p ss-pdf\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0 Briefing_Pro-poor analysis of Kenyas 201819 budget estimates\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"p ss-download\"></i>\n</a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div> Modal <div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"modal pdf-popup\">\n<div class=\"modal-dialog wide\">\n<div class=\"modal-body \">\n<div>\n<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"btn-close\" href=\"#\" id=\"close-pdf-modal\">\u00d7</a>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t          Can we contact you later to ask your opinion about the publication you just downloaded?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf yes, please leave your email below.

If the needs of the poorest people are not well targeted by government resources, if insufficient tax is raised (or raised in ways that penalise the poor), and if support systems are under or inefficiently financed, then people with the most need are at the greatest risk of being left behind.</p>\n<p>Our analysis provides an in-depth look at allocations to sectors that are considered to have a direct reach and effect on the poor population. It shows that although the Kenyan government is allocating more resources to pro-poor sectors in 2018/19 compared with previous years, these resources still do not adequately address the needs of their most vulnerable citizens.

Equally, the important part that official development assistance (ODA) can play in helping to strengthen and scale up domestic resource mobilisation for development is well understood. This has led to significant political attention and action, most notably with development partners committing in the Addis Tax Initiative (ATI) to double ODA\u00a0for domestic resource mobilisation\u00a0and improve policy coherence.</p>\n<p>However, these commitments \u2013 that political consensus \u2013 have failed to realise substantial progress at the country level.

The government of Nepal, supported by development partners, has established the Aid Management Platform (AMP) and launched its public website. Several other platforms and initiatives have been put in place by various actors with the aim of providing aid-related and humanitarian information, in particular following the 2015 earthquake in Nepal. This reflects a growing demand for increased production, sharing and use of data to meet development aims, as well as improved transparency and accountability.</p>\n<p>Internationally, there has also been an increase in the availability and quality of data. The International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) now has more than 600 bilateral, multilateral, non-government and private sector development partners publishing data to its standard. The Data Revolution has brought the role of data in meeting and monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to the fore. What is less clear, is the extent to which aid data is being used, by whom and for what purpose, and it is this that the discussion paper seeks to investigate for the specific case of aid information use in one country.</p>\n<p>This discussion paper highlights information needs of different stakeholder groups to assist user-centred approaches to providing data on aid finance, considers the potential role of data published to the IATI Standard in this context, and builds interest in increased use of data on aid finance among key stakeholder groups.</p>\n<p>Key findings</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Many stakeholders share common interests and needs with regard to financial information on aid. There is a shared motivation to understand how aid is allocated, spent and what results it contributes to.</li>\n<li>There is a demand for more analytical information, in particular on needs, resources and results of development interventions; aid in relation to national SDGs and other indicators; and aid in relation to domestic resources.</li>\n<li>Despite the increase in availability of aid data from national and international sources and platforms, in practice stakeholders rely strongly on written reports, organisational websites and their interpersonal networks to access and use the information they need.</li>\n<li>Greater efforts are needed to increase the awareness of aid data availability from the AMP and IATI, and to engage proactively with different user groups and intermediaries who can support the translation of data into actionable analysis. Ideally this would build on existing information and communication preferences, and coordination fora to enhance these with better data and analysis.</li>\n<li>For this, openness of aid data and its interoperability with other sources of official and administrative data is critical.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Aid-data-needs-and-use-cases-in-Nepal.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Download the discussion paper</a></p>\n<p><em>This discussion paper was co-authored by Conrad Zellmann of DI and Kishor Pradhan, an independent consultant.

It presents key analysis on how donors currently allocate ODA toward enabling environment support and highlights the gaps in evidence that prevent effective decision-making and impactful investments.

The proportion of each loan that will be counted as ODA will depend on how concessional the terms of that loan are \u2013 the more concessional, the higher the proportion of the loan will be counted. These new rules will result in significant changes to the level of ODA reported by some donors.</p>\n<p>This briefing explains the changes in detail and, using real life examples, investigates how these they will affect the net ODA figure that is used to assess donors\u2019 performance against ODA targets.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Accounting-for-ODA-loans-The-effect-of-the-new-rules.xlsx\" target=\"_blank\">Download the data</a></p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Coding the P20 \u2013 How we developed and coded the P20 Initiative", "authors": ["Alex Miller"], "format": "Background paper", "date": "23 Feb 2018", "description": "This paper discusses the data used in the P20 Initiative, highlighting its origins, what difficulties were encountered, and the methods used to analyse it.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/coding-p20-developed-coded-p20-initiative/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"p-t--1 p-b--1 m-b--1\" style=\"border-top:2px solid #f2f2f2; border-bottom:2px solid #f2f2f2;\">\n<div style=\"overflow:hidden;\">\n<div class=\"col-md-7\">\n<div><a class=\"btn btn--dark pdf-download\" ga-event-action=\"pdf-download\" ga-event-category=\"Download\" ga-event-label=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Coding-the-P20-How-we-developed-and-coded-the-P20-Initiative.pdf\" ga-on=\"click\" href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Coding-the-P20-How-we-developed-and-coded-the-P20-Initiative.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Coding the P20 - How we developed and coded the P20 Initiative\">\n<i class=\"p ss-pdf\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0 Coding the P20 - How we developed and coded the P20 Initiative\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"p ss-download\"></i>\n</a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div> Modal <div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"modal pdf-popup\">\n<div class=\"modal-dialog wide\">\n<div class=\"modal-body \">\n<div>\n<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"btn-close\" href=\"#\" id=\"close-pdf-modal\">\u00d7</a>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t          Can we contact you later to ask your opinion about the publication you just downloaded?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf yes, please leave your email below.

In 2017/18, Uganda\u2019s revenue was 15% of GDP; Rwanda\u2019s was 17.6% and Kenya\u2019s was 20.5%.</p>\n<p>Government has continued to provide progressive reforms in areas that reduce the burden of taxation on the poorest people. VAT exceptions in such area as animal feed and irrigation systems, is one example.</p>\n<p><strong>Non-concessional finance</strong></p>\n<p>Government is borrowing heavily from non-concessional sources to drive industrialisation policy.</p>\n<p>Such a strategy requires the government ensure financing is appropriately used: unless the investment leads to increased growth, there is the potential for debt vulnerability and rising interest payments.</p>\n<h5><strong>Focus on industrialisation</strong></h5>\n<p>Uganda trails regional neighbours in funding sectors benefiting the poorest. In 2017/18 such sectors as education and agriculture have seen only marginal increases, with environment and water, social development and health sectors seeing funding cuts.</p>\n<h5><strong>Development partner support</strong></h5>\n<p>Overall, Government is reducing dependence on development partners; however, it continues to rely significantly on their support in sectors relevant to the poorest.</p>\n<p>By supporting priority areas, disbursing in timely fashion and providing predictability of funding over the medium term, development partners will maximise their positive impact on government planning.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/dfataustralianaid/10665321703/in/photolist-hfsyyX-dNJqpn-dNQ2mS-dkWyjF-RNCVHS-eQc3nj-6FirvL-dSGcrn-6FiriU-oFmDXh-SaKAFr-pHknJn-qn11wa-7g2nPH-3brkWN-7g2sPH-kK3pMZ-7gQqTe-nmiC4m-beXpQX-nnxysC-9nZML7-7g6ipf-9vCmqL-pHqKeC-dNPZS5-dNJsxa-g7LZdM-e1w8K5-R6F3fL-49kYUg-49kZdr-dfejSN-XiWxmd-7AQ3Sy-dNJqb2-7g6hJb-Sccsra-5Pwqsx-f3Yjwf-bvmawC-nmhixo-jAXjSe-nmhebP-eePMs8-bvm6tN-d1SnbY-bvm5RA-nmhJtX-bJfP72\" target=\"_blank\">Photo: Kate Holt/Africa Practice</a></p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Identifying government entities", "authors": [], "format": "Discussion paper", "date": "03 Oct 2017", "description": "This paper explores options for a universal method of identifying government entities in datasets describing transactions from or to government agencies.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/identifying-government-entities/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"><p><em>This paper was written by Tim Davies of\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.opendataservices.coop/\">Open Data Services Co-operative\u00a0</a>with financial support from the <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/projects/joined-data-standards/\">Joined-up Data Standards</a> (JUDS) project.

This will remain the case until better sources of data are available through credible, functioning and sustainable systems. There are three major international household survey programmes in use around the world.</p>\n<h3>Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS)</h3>\n<p>The Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) is an international household survey programme developed by the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) in the 1990s. MICS was originally created to monitor the goals of the <a href=\"https://www.unicef.org/wsc/\">1990 World Summit for Children</a>.[1] Since then, close to 300 surveys have been carried out in over 100 countries.</p>\n<h3>Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS)</h3>\n<p>The Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) is a nationally-representative household survey developed by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in the 1980s. DHS built on previous work in the 1970s through the <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1965479?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\">World Fertility Survey and Contraceptive Prevalence Surveys</a>.[2] Since then, over 300 surveys have been carried out in just under 100 countries.</p>\n<h3>Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS)</h3>\n<p>The Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) is a household survey developed by the Development Research Group at the World Bank in the 1980s. The programme is housed in the Survey Unit of the World Bank\u2019s Development Data Group. Since the 1980s, over 100 surveys have been carried out in just under 40 countries.</p>\n<p></p></div></li> <li><a aria-controls=\"accordion-1-c2\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"true\" aria-selected=\"false\" class=\"accordion-title\" id=\"accordion-1-t2\" role=\"tab\" tabindex=\"0\">Who funds and supports household surveys?</a><div aria-hidden=\"true\" aria-labelledby=\"accordion-1-t2\" class=\"accordion-content\" id=\"accordion-1-c2\" role=\"tabpanel\">\n<ul>\n<li><strong>DHSs </strong>are funded and developed by USAID while their implementation is coordinated by ICF International, a strategic consulting firm, with support from other partners.

Government institutions typically fund and carry out the surveys themselves, with financial support from donors and technical assistance from UNICEF and its partners.</li>\n<li>The <strong>LSMS programme</strong> is financed, developed and implemented by national statistical offices in collaboration with the Word Bank, with the Bank providing technical assistance. LSMS and related surveys generally known as Household Income and Expenditure Surveys are highly customised between countries and their funding schemes can vary significantly. A recent component of the LSMS is its Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA). This has significant funding from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.

For DHS and MICS, there are different questionnaires for the household, women and men and questionnaires that measure biological well-being by measuring height, weight and other factors. Most standard DHS and MICS include a minimum of household and women\u2019s surveys. Countries choose which modules to include to meet their needs. DHS and MICS also have some specialised modules and surveys that focus on specific populations or specific issues (such as malaria or HIV and AIDS).</p>\n<h4>Figure 2: Survey architecture</h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Figure-2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-14935 size-full\" height=\"557\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1021px) 100vw, 1021px\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Figure-2.jpg\" srcset=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Figure-2.jpg 1021w, http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Figure-2-768x419.jpg 768w\" width=\"1021\"/></a></p>\n<p></p></div></li><li><a aria-controls=\"accordion-1-c6\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"true\" aria-selected=\"false\" class=\"accordion-title\" id=\"accordion-1-t6\" role=\"tab\" tabindex=\"0\">How do the surveys compare?</a><div aria-hidden=\"true\" aria-labelledby=\"accordion-1-t6\" class=\"accordion-content\" id=\"accordion-1-c6\" role=\"tabpanel\">\n<p>Historically each survey had a purposeful origin: DHS monitored world fertility and contraception prevalence while MICS captured the status of children. Although each household survey contains unique, useful modules, as the surveys have evolved and worked together to harmonise common practices and associated tools \u2013 and due to country data needs \u2013 they have begun to resemble each other.</p>\n<p>Previous research carried out by Development Initiatives found that two-thirds of the questions in the DHS and MICS surveys, the most widely used, are either identical or similar enough to be practically comparable;[4] 77% of all MICs questions can be found in DHS, and 66% of all DHS questions can be found in MICS.</p>\n<h4>Table 1: DHS and MICS question matches across questionnaires</h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Table-1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-14937 size-full\" height=\"372\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Table-1.jpg\" width=\"736\"/></a></p>\n<p>Source: Analysis carried out by Development Initiatives as part of the Joined-up Data Standards project \u2013 see the discussion paper: <a href=\"http://juds.joinedupdata.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/160628-Final-DP4-for-publication.pdf\"><em>Household surveys: do competing standards serve country needs?</em></a>[5] Based on analysis between DHS-VII and MICS5.</p>\n<p>However, data users needing to pull this data together for comparative analysis still face challenges. Although questions are duplicated across surveys, each survey follows its own coding standards for variables meaning duplicated questions cannot easily be matched. As a result, merging or comparing across datasets from different surveys to make a continuous data trend is both labour intensive and costly. Additionally, not only is the data coded differently between DHS and MICS, but data structures are substantially different between versions and rounds of the same survey.</p>\n<p>In March 2015, the UN Statistical Commission endorsed establishing an <a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/iswghs/\">Intersecretariat Working Group on Household Surveys</a> to \u2018foster coordination and harmonisation of household survey activities\u2019.[6]</p>\n<p></p></div></li><li><a aria-controls=\"accordion-1-c7\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"true\" aria-selected=\"false\" class=\"accordion-title\" id=\"accordion-1-t7\" role=\"tab\" tabindex=\"0\">What is the average sample size of the surveys?</a><div aria-hidden=\"true\" aria-labelledby=\"accordion-1-t7\" class=\"accordion-content\" id=\"accordion-1-c7\" role=\"tabpanel\">\n<p>There is considerable variation in the size of surveys. India\u2019s 2015\u201316 DHS will include about 600,000 households while Samoa\u2019s 2009 DHS includes 1,947 households. However, sample size can also vary within a country. Uganda\u2019s four DHS surveys since 2010 have surveyed between 4,500 and 20,000 households. The sample size of a survey is determined by two dimensions. First, the number of subnational domains required for disaggregated reporting. Second, a calculation that works out the number of households required in each domain sample to reach the target population. What appears at first to be counterintuitive is that the sample size required for any country is not related to the total population of the country but rather to the number of domains (subnational divisions) chosen.</p>\n<p></p></div></li><li><a aria-controls=\"accordion-1-c8\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"true\" aria-selected=\"false\" class=\"accordion-title\" id=\"accordion-1-t8\" role=\"tab\" tabindex=\"0\">How much does a household survey cost?</a><div aria-hidden=\"true\" aria-labelledby=\"accordion-1-t8\" class=\"accordion-content\" id=\"accordion-1-c8\" role=\"tabpanel\">\n<p>The cost of a survey depends on many factors such as the sample size of surveyed population; size of the survey (number of modules); population density; income level; and level of technical assistance required, which often depends on the statistical capacity of a given country.</p>\n<p>Research from the Sustainable Development Solutions Network[7] estimated that among 77 of the countries receiving the most aid, the average cost per survey was US$1.6 million per DHS, US$1.0 million per MICS and US$1.7 million per LSMS-type survey.</p>\n<p></p></div></li><li><a aria-controls=\"accordion-1-c9\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"true\" aria-selected=\"false\" class=\"accordion-title\" id=\"accordion-1-t9\" role=\"tab\" tabindex=\"0\">What are the data limitations?</a><div aria-hidden=\"true\" aria-labelledby=\"accordion-1-t9\" class=\"accordion-content\" id=\"accordion-1-c9\" role=\"tabpanel\">\n<p>To adequately sample the population, these surveys require accurate, current census information about the underlying population. Many countries do not have current census data and rely on biased information for sampling. Sampling also limits the extent to which data can be disaggregated. Most DHS and MICS surveys are only designed to represent a few subnational areas, limiting the ability of data users to provide rich disaggregated data beyond those levels.</p>\n<p>Timeliness is another concern with these surveys. Analysing and cleaning the data can take up to two years after the survey has been completed. This could lead to the data being outdated before it is used extensively.</p>\n<p></p></div></li><li><a aria-controls=\"accordion-1-c10\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"true\" aria-selected=\"false\" class=\"accordion-title\" id=\"accordion-1-t10\" role=\"tab\" tabindex=\"0\">What is not included in surveys?</a><div aria-hidden=\"true\" aria-labelledby=\"accordion-1-t10\" class=\"accordion-content\" id=\"accordion-1-c10\" role=\"tabpanel\">\n<p>By definition, household surveys include data on households. The definition of households can vary widely but this generally excludes people living on the street, in refugee or internally-displaced persons camps, in institutions such as prisons or orphanages,[8] and nomadic people.</p>\n<p>In their current form, DHS and MICS are designed to focus on women of reproductive age (15\u201349) and children under 5. This means that relatively few questions are produced with these surveys for children between the ages of 5 and 15.

Out of a total of 51 organisations that signed up to the Grand Bargain:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>43% (22 organisations) are already members of IATI</li>\n<li>73% (37 organisations or their members or affiliates) already publish some data to the IATI Standard</li>\n<li>61% (31 organisations or their members or affiliates) currently publish humanitarian aid data to IATI</li>\n</ul>\n<p>More information on humanitarian funding is now becoming available, but there is still a need for more and better quality data. The report calls on Grand Bargain signatories to take steps to begin publishing their humanitarian data to IATI and to improve the quality of the data they publish.</p>\n<p>The report uses IATI data published in a <a href=\"http://46.101.46.6/dashboard\" target=\"_blank\">bespoke dashboard</a> to enable signatories to track their own progress against the commitment. The dashboard was developed by DI, and is publicly available in beta version.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Baseline-report_-implementing-and-monitoring-the-Grand-Bargain-commitment-on-transparency.pdf\">Read the report</a></p>\n<h4>More information</h4>\n<p>Download <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/an-introduction-to-iati-for-humanitarian-actors/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>An introduction to IATI for humanitarian actors</em></a></p>\n<p>Listen to our webinar series <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/webinar-improving-humanitarian-transparency-with-iati/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Improving humanitarian transparency with IATI</em></a></p>\n<p>Read the <a href=\"https://consultations.worldhumanitariansummit.org/bitcache/075d4c18b82e0853e3d393e90af18acf734baf29?vid=580250&amp;disposition=inline&amp;op=view\" target=\"_blank\">Grand Bargain commitment from the World Humanitarian Summit 2016</a></p>\n<p>Photo: <a class=\"owner-name truncate\" data-rapid_p=\"54\" data-track=\"attributionNameClick\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/unicefua/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Go to UNICEF Ukraine's photostream\">UNICEF Ukraine</a></p>\n<div class=\"attribution-info\"></div>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Aid spending by Development Assistance Committee (DAC) donors in 2016", "authors": [], "format": "Factsheet", "date": "12 Apr 2017", "description": "This factsheet details official development assistance emerging from the provisional 2017 OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) data release.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/aid-spending-by-development-assistance-committee-dac-donors-in-2016/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"><p>In this factsheet we provide an overview of key trends in official development assistance (ODA) emerging from the provisional 2017 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC) data release.</p>\n</div><div class=\"p-t--1 p-b--1 m-b--1\" style=\"border-top:2px solid #f2f2f2; border-bottom:2px solid #f2f2f2;\">\n<div style=\"overflow:hidden;\">\n<div class=\"col-md-7\">\n<div><a class=\"btn btn--dark pdf-download\" ga-event-action=\"pdf-download\" ga-event-category=\"Download\" ga-event-label=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/aid-spending-by-Development-Assistance-Committee-DAC-donors-in-2016.pdf\" ga-on=\"click\" href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/aid-spending-by-Development-Assistance-Committee-DAC-donors-in-2016.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"aid-spending-by-Development-Assistance-Committee-DAC-donors-in-2016\">\n<i class=\"p ss-pdf\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0 aid-spending-by-Development-Assistance-Committee-DAC-donors-in-2016\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"p ss-download\"></i>\n</a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div> Modal <div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"modal pdf-popup\">\n<div class=\"modal-dialog wide\">\n<div class=\"modal-body \">\n<div>\n<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"btn-close\" href=\"#\" id=\"close-pdf-modal\">\u00d7</a>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t          Can we contact you later to ask your opinion about the publication you just downloaded?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf yes, please leave your email below.

Its goal is to end poverty in all its forms everywhere, with a specific target to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030 and a commitment to leave no one behind. Achieving these ambitions will be much harder than meeting the Millennium Development Goals. It will require a different mindset, and new ways of measuring and monitoring progress.</p>\n<p>We need to harness the energy of the data revolution and measure progress by counting people not averages, so that no one \u2013 no matter where they live, how old they are and irrespective of their gender, sexual orientation or disabilities \u2013 is left behind.</p>\n<p>Rather than establishing a new measurement, the P20 is a simple concept that seeks to focus political attention on the poorest 20% of people. Like the SDGs, it is a concept that is universally applicable, so it is relevant to decision-makers at all levels \u2013 globally, nationally and in every sector and every community.</p>\n<p>This report focuses on the global P20, the poorest 20% of people in the world. Agenda 2030 puts forward a comprehensive framework of 17 goals, 169 targets and 230 indicators. There is a risk that attention to the poorest people will be lost in this complexity and monitoring efforts will get bogged down in the detail. The P20 Initiative will try to keep the focus on the bigger picture, using three simple \u2018bellwethers\u2019 drawn from the SDG framework and based on income, nutrition and civil registration.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/P20-Initiative-baseline-report.pdf\">Download the full report here</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/P20-Initiative-graphic-summary.pdf\">Download our graphic summary here</a></p>\n<p>Homepage image credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/asiandevelopmentbank/8426492038/in/photolist-dQBYvu-fTQpp-83TzTy-ojFcAN-cRN2Yf-986JG1-ddEnPe-mYmAF2-brvNvS-BtcWbK-dgeyLL-ppQFH9-983ydH-6YMmV4-9woP57-83QtnK-qQQbQ-6MJNi3-qQQbR-bb37K4-dget1c-bifpb2-dgeBmx-BueW7f-cRGPFU-cp3v1-dgeu2c-9uRA9c-eecW4M-cRN6SQ-9wkUYP-biChbK-983piD-986M3A-dPGftN-dgenwE-biHz5D-983BZV-dgev7N-6fgYk8-986BNm-Asn3K-83TA4Q-986CVf-dgewHM-dgezwW-dgeA2P-dgemAZ-dgdKud-bjceMx\" target=\"_blank\">Asian Development Bank</a></p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Citizen-generated data and sustainable development: Evidence from case studies in Kenya and Uganda", "authors": [], "format": "Report", "date": "24 Mar 2017", "description": "In 2016, Making All Voices Count commissioned DI and DRT to conduct a one-year study on citizen-generated data in Kenya and Uganda.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/citizen-generated-data-and-sustainable-development-evidence-from-case-studies-in-kenya-and-uganda-2/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"><p>In March 2016, <a href=\"http://www.makingallvoicescount.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Making All Voices Count</a> commissioned Development Initiatives and <a href=\"http://drt-ug.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Development Research and Training</a>\u00a0(DRT) to conduct a one-year study on the use of citizen-generated data in two different cases in Uganda and Kenya.</p>\n</div><div class=\"p-t--1 p-b--1 m-b--1\" style=\"border-top:2px solid #f2f2f2; border-bottom:2px solid #f2f2f2;\">\n<div style=\"overflow:hidden;\">\n<div class=\"col-md-7\">\n<div><a class=\"btn btn--dark pdf-download\" ga-event-action=\"pdf-download\" ga-event-category=\"Download\" ga-event-label=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/citizen-generated-data-and-sustainable-development-evidence-from-case-studies-in-Kenya-and-Uganda.pdf\" ga-on=\"click\" href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/citizen-generated-data-and-sustainable-development-evidence-from-case-studies-in-Kenya-and-Uganda.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"citizen-generated data and sustainable development - Kenya and Uganda\">\n<i class=\"p ss-pdf\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0 citizen-generated data and sustainable development - Kenya and Uganda\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"p ss-download\"></i>\n</a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div> Modal <div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"modal pdf-popup\">\n<div class=\"modal-dialog wide\">\n<div class=\"modal-body \">\n<div>\n<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"btn-close\" href=\"#\" id=\"close-pdf-modal\">\u00d7</a>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t          Can we contact you later to ask your opinion about the publication you just downloaded?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf yes, please leave your email below.

Over 45% of the country\u2019s population live below the national poverty line,[1] and the poorest fifth of the population share only 4.8% of the country\u2019s income.[2] Kenya also experiences inequalities at the sub-national level. In Turkana County, for example, an individual is 15 times less likely to have access to a secondary education, compared to an individual in Nairobi County. Even within counties, inequality persists. In a ward in Kilifi County, 84.5% of the population live below the poverty line, yet within another ward the figure is 39%.[3]</p>\n<p>It\u2019s vital that resource allocations are interrogated in order to ensure they address poverty and inequalities.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the facts we know so far about Kenya\u2019s national budget for 2017/18.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The government plans to spend Ksh 2.29 trillion. It aims to raise Ksh 1.7 trillion in revenues, while projects grants are expected to increase by 14.3%. The overall budget deficit will amount to Ksh 0.52 billion.</li>\n<li>The country will be in a contractionary fiscal policy phase, as the government plans to reduce fiscal deficit by 21.3% (resulting from a cut in development expenditure and an increase in estimated revenue).</li>\n<li>Development expenditure will amount to 27.9% of the overall estimated budget of Ksh 2.29 trillion; this is less than the minimum 30% threshold provided by law.</li>\n<li>Domestic sources will play a bigger role in 2017/18. They will finance 60.7% of the overall budget deficit and 58.7% of the development expenditure. Moreover, the government plans to increase net domestic borrowing by 12.4% (which is likely to put pressure on the domestic market).</li>\n<li>Pressure to repay loans from commercial financing is greater in fiscal year 2017/18, when foreign repayment will jump by 242%, in line with an earlier IMF warning.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Budgets 2015/16\u20132017/18: Expenditure, revenue and deficit</h5>\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/figure-1-pro-poor-budget-2017-2018-kenya/\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-12554\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 846px) 100vw, 846px\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Figure-1-pro-poor-budget-2017-2018-Kenya.png\" srcset=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Figure-1-pro-poor-budget-2017-2018-Kenya.png 1263w, http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Figure-1-pro-poor-budget-2017-2018-Kenya-768x272.png 768w\" width=\"846\"/></a></p>\n<p><strong>Source: </strong>DI based on figures in budget documents for financial years 2015/16\u20132017/18</p>\n<h3>Redistribution of revenue to the sub-national governments</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>National government has allocated more than twice the constitutional requirement (15%) in equitable share to county governments for 2017/18. However, the huge variations in the last audited revenues \u2013 the basis for the share \u2013 and projected revenues of respective years between 2015/16 and 2017/18 leave the equitable share well below 20%.</li>\n<li>Conditional grants to counties, provided to support implementation of the devolved system, have increased by close to 50% in 2017/18 compared to the previous year. The biggest increase (97.5 % compared to 2016/17) is the Ksh 7.9 billion conditional grant that allows counties to maintain roads.</li>\n<li>Although indicated in budget statements 2015/16 and 2016/17, no disbursement of the Equalization Fund (launched 11 March 2016) has been made so far because the disbursement framework has not been finalised.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Pro-poor budgetary allocations: to sectors that directly target the poorest people</h3>\n<h4>Health</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Free primary health care: no change in the Ksh 900 million allocations from the previous two financial years.</li>\n<li>Health insurance for the elderly and persons with disabilities: Ksh 300 million is allocated, which is lower than the Health Sector Working Group\u2019s recommendation of Ksh 500 million.</li>\n<li>Free maternal health care: no change in the Ksh 4.3 billion allocations as two previous financial years. The conditional grant (now special grant) of Ksh 3.4 billion has been reduced by Ksh 900 million, compared to 2016/17.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Education</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Free primary school education: of the total Ksh 21.8 billion allocated for primary education, 87.5% is earmarked for free primary education \u2013 more than the share in total primary education budget in 2016/17.</li>\n<li>Free day secondary school education: a total of total of Ksh 34.7 billion allocated, of which only 3.8% (Ksh 1.3 billion) is earmarked as capital expenditure while the rest is current expenditure.</li>\n<li>School feeding programme: receives an allocation of Ksh 2.5 billion, which also includes resources from donors. This is less than the Ksh 4.5 billion amount requirement.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Share of free primary education, free day secondary education and school feeding programmes in total respective programme and State Department budget</h5>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/table-1-pro-poor-budget-2017-18-kenya/\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-12555\" height=\"500\" sizes=\"(max-width: 958px) 100vw, 958px\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Table-1-pro-poor-budget-2017-18-Kenya.png\" srcset=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Table-1-pro-poor-budget-2017-18-Kenya.png 1293w, http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Table-1-pro-poor-budget-2017-18-Kenya-768x401.png 768w\" width=\"958\"/></a></p>\n<p>Source: Budget documents between 2015/16 and 2017/18 and Education Sector Working Group Report 2016.</p>\n<p>Note: Free primary education and school health, nutrition and meals fall under the broader \u2018Primary Education\u2019 programme while free day secondary education is under \u2018Secondary Education\u2019 programme.</p>\n<h4>Social protection</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Ksh 24.2 billion (2% of overall 2017/18 budget) is earmarked for social protection programmes, a 6% increase from the previous financial year.</li>\n<li>National Safety Net Programme will receive Ksh 20 billion for state cash transfers to more than 1 million households with older persons, orphans, vulnerable children and persons with disabilities.</li>\n<li>National Development Fund for persons with disabilities: the fund will be allocated Ksh 400 million \u2013 higher than 2016/17 by Ksh 100 million. This is 54% more than what the Medium Term Expenditure Framework recommended for 2017/18.<strong>\u00a0</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Drought management</h3>\n<p>In February 2017, the government declared the current drought as a national emergency. So far, the drought has affected 2.7 million Kenyans (6.8% of the population) living in 23 of the 47 counties.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ksh 5.1 billion (three-quarters of the State Department for Special Programmes budget) is earmarked for drought management in 2017/18. This amount is less than that earmarked in 2016/2017 by 11%.</li>\n<li>The Hunger Safety Net Programme that supports 84,600 households in Mandera, Wajir, Marsabit and Turkana counties has been allocated Ksh 3.5 billion in the coming financial year.</li>\n<li>It is difficult to identify the exact amount allocated to \u2018end drought emergency\u2019 from the budget documents, since drought intervention measures are undertaken by various ministries, departments and agencies. Furthermore, there are often off-budgetary allocations and supplementary budget submissions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The government has allocated more resources to pro-poor sectors in 2017/18 compared to the previous two financial years.[4] However, this is not an indication that allocations are adequate, since some of the programme budget estimates are lower than the required amounts stated in sectoral medium-term expenditure frameworks. What\u2019s more, greater allocations do not always amount to acceptable expenditure performance \u2013 some sectors have received adverse audit opinion in the latest Auditor General\u2019s report (2014/15).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/A-summary-of-Kenya\u2019s-budget-2017-18-from-a-pro-poor-perspective.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Download the factsheet here</strong></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/analysis-of-kenyas-budget-201718-whats-in-it-for-the-poorest-people/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read the report here</strong></a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\"></a></p>\n</div><div class=\"row--cards\" ng-if=\"post.notes\">\n<div class=\"col-md-12 card m-b--2\">\n<div class=\"card__content bg--light\">\n<h3 class=\"h3\">Notes</h3>\n<div> <p>[1] KNBS and SID (2013).

It does so by reviewing national and regional initiatives that might lead to a deepening of technical and political discussions to further a coherent and shared approach to measuring and monitoring South\u2013South cooperation.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Approaches-to-measuring-and-monitoring-South\u2013South-cooperation.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Download the full discussion paper</a></strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/asiandevelopmentbank/8594961522/in/photolist-e6vqBL-72ZtVU-e6vpYs-5fTooX-e6pMAX-rR38Kv-pHwwWV-ebFo9H-9NBTQp-9nXs8s-kmywpW-bXfXkg-ebM2DJ-ebM2JJ-9Vfdqa-ha1HUp-dQBCBA-c4nb9-5vFd5t-97fQy7-nUY8Ap-9NKJWL-f3SK7G-ecqtdw-7N9t1h-74Gtbz-eEu5Wj-pr2ZeT-saPdjn-bAxjvj-kmwscx-7zmDvJ-a7dkZg-pNX6LD-pE3jyq-vccDF-pNWG7e-pP5YN3-pP1jKr-pP8NNj-dQBtqu-pP77R4-axLoA3-4VH3EF-q6cmL6-q6tfHM-8VAJxi-kKoeR7-pP2AwC-dgU6w1\" target=\"_blank\">Image: Asian Development Bank</a></p>\n</div><div class=\"row--cards\" ng-if=\"post.notes\">\n<div class=\"col-md-12 card m-b--2\">\n<div class=\"card__content bg--light\">\n<h3 class=\"h3\">Notes</h3>\n<div> <p>Contact us if you\u2019d like to reproduce our data in a format other than those supplied.</p>\n<p>We encourage dissemination of our work provided a reference is included.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Counting cash: Tracking humanitarian expenditure on cash-based programming", "authors": [], "format": "Report", "date": "13 Feb 2017", "description": "This report, commissioned by the Overseas Development Institute, includes data on the volume and nature of humanitarian cash-based programming in 2015.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/counting-cash-tracking-humanitarian-expenditure-on-cash-based-programming/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"><p><a href=\"https://www.odi.org/publications/10716-counting-cash-tracking-humanitarian-expenditure-cash-based-programming\" target=\"_blank\">This report</a>, commissioned by the <a href=\"https://www.odi.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Overseas Development Institute</a>, includes data on the volume and nature of humanitarian cash-based programming in 2015 and suggests practical ways to improve tracking of funding for cash and vouchers in the future.</p>\n</div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p><a href=\"https://www.odi.org/publications/10716-counting-cash-tracking-humanitarian-expenditure-cash-based-programming\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>View the full report here</strong></a></p>\n<p>Assistance provided as cash or vouchers to people affected by humanitarian crises can offer greater choice and empowerment compared with assistance provided as goods in kind. At the World Humanitarian Summit in May 2016, many of the world\u2019s largest humanitarian donors and agencies made a set of commitments, as part of a \u2018Grand Bargain\u2019, to improve the efficiency, effectiveness and accountability of humanitarian assistance. Among the commitments was an agreement to \u2018increase the use and coordination of cash-based programming\u2019.</p>\n<p>There is currently no accurate, globally comparable data on the volume of assistance delivered in the form of cash and vouchers. In <a href=\"https://www.odi.org/publications/10716-counting-cash-tracking-humanitarian-expenditure-cash-based-programming\" target=\"_blank\">this report </a>we aim to fill that gap by providing a baseline estimate on the volume and nature of cash-based programming in 2015.</p>\n<p><strong>Key findings</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Data from aid agencies suggests that, in 2015, at least $1.9 billion was spent on humanitarian assistance in the form of cash-based responses (51% cash and 49% vouchers).</li>\n<li>There is currently no systematic tracking of the volume of humanitarian assistance delivered in the form of cash and vouchers. As such, the international system is not ready to report on its cash-related commitments from the 2016 World Humanitarian Summit and the Grand Bargain.</li>\n<li>The overarching barrier to better data on expenditure by modality is the lack of a single, comprehensive systematic means of reporting on programming by cash, voucher and in-kind assistance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>All actors \u2013 donors and implementing organisations \u2013 advocate for and invest in the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Financial Tracking Service (FTS) and the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) as the best long-term options for systematic global reporting on cash, voucher and in-kind expenditure.</li>\n<li>Agencies implementing cash-based programmes agree on a standard template for the reporting, collection and collation of \u2018who does what, where\u2019 data on assistance by modality, with cash- and voucher-specific fields, and coordinate its use at country-level. This data can be linked with the funding data on the FTS to give a picture of actual spending and delivery by modality.</li>\n<li>All relevant actors are consistent with the use of terminology and data on cash-based programming. That paves the way for agreeing on common ways to disaggregate the data and estimate the relevant programming costs that agencies incur as they build up internal capacity on cash. This financial data, if combined effectively with comparable data on results and impact, can be used to support decision-making on the best way of providing assistance in any given context.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.odi.org/publications/10716-counting-cash-tracking-humanitarian-expenditure-cash-based-programming\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>View the full report here</strong></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/counting-cash/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our blog:\u00a0Counting cash in humanitarian contexts</strong></a></p>\n<p>Image credit:\u00a0Vicki Francis/Department for International Development</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Assessment of Kenya's preparedness to disasters caused by natural hazards: floods, drought and disease outbreak", "authors": [], "format": "Report", "date": "26 Jan 2017", "description": "Through key informant interviews, focus-group discussions, literature review and a financial analysis, this report evaluates Kenya's resilience.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/assessment-of-kenyas-preparedness-to-disasters-caused-by-natural-hazards-floods-drought-and-disease-outbreak/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"><p>In March 2016, the UK\u2019s Department for International Development commissioned Development Initiatives to conduct a political economy study on Kenya\u2019s preparedness to disasters caused by natural hazards, namely floods, droughts and disease outbreaks \u2013 human and animal.</p>\n</div><div class=\"p-t--1 p-b--1 m-b--1\" style=\"border-top:2px solid #f2f2f2; border-bottom:2px solid #f2f2f2;\">\n<div style=\"overflow:hidden;\">\n<div class=\"col-md-7\">\n<div><a class=\"btn btn--dark pdf-download\" ga-event-action=\"pdf-download\" ga-event-category=\"Download\" ga-event-label=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Assessment-of-Kenyas-preparedness-to-disasters-caused-by-natural-hazards_report_7th-February.pdf\" ga-on=\"click\" href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Assessment-of-Kenyas-preparedness-to-disasters-caused-by-natural-hazards_report_7th-February.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Assessment-of-Kenyas-preparedness-to-disasters-caused-by-natural-hazards_report\">\n<i class=\"p ss-pdf\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0 Assessment-of-Kenyas-preparedness-to-disasters-caused-by-natural-hazards_report\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"p ss-download\"></i>\n</a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div> Modal <div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"modal pdf-popup\">\n<div class=\"modal-dialog wide\">\n<div class=\"modal-body \">\n<div>\n<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"btn-close\" href=\"#\" id=\"close-pdf-modal\">\u00d7</a>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t          Can we contact you later to ask your opinion about the publication you just downloaded?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf yes, please leave your email below.

We applied a number of tools to gather evidence: key informant interviews, focus-group discussions, literature review and a financial analysis.</p>\n<p>Our respondents ranged from Members of Parliament, Members of the County Assembly, national and subnational government employees, donors, United Nations agencies, international NGOs, academia, local organisations, research institutes, media, community leaders, women\u2019s organisations and members of the community.</p>\n<p>We assess preparedness under different frameworks \u2013 guided by UNISDR and UNOCHA definitions: governance and legal; capacity to prepare; linkages to international processes of disaster preparedness; and financial allocations to preparedness.</p>\n<h4><strong>Main findings from the study</strong></h4>\n<ol>\n<li>There are <strong>no existing legal frameworks</strong> in place guiding the country\u2019s disaster preparedness. There appears to be <strong>lack of political will</strong> to prioritise this. With the lack of guiding principles, <strong>coordination</strong> of preparedness across the different disasters <strong>is not strong</strong>.</li>\n<li>The country <strong>lacks a culture of preparedness</strong>: preparedness is much more reactive than proactive. There are <strong>multiple coordination platforms</strong> across the various actors that are perceived as useful but rely only on good relationships to work. Drought preparedness appears much better coordinated than flood and disease preparedness.</li>\n<li>Resource allocations for disaster preparedness appear to be increasing, particularly through aid. The allocations at the national and subnational budgets could be increased to meet demands. Kenya contributes the highest annual premium among African countries (US$9 million/KES 900 million) to the Africa Risk Capacity (ARC); an insurance cover against drought. Though it has not received any payout yet, this investment ought to be promoted as we found <strong>little understanding of ARC</strong> among our respondents.</li>\n<li>In the 23 counties where the National Drought Management Authority operates, disaster preparedness is much better coordinated compared to the other 24 counties.</li>\n<li>There is <strong>demonstration of gender inclusion and participation</strong> in preparedness at county level. In Mandera County, it is a requirement that Community Managed Disaster Risk Reduction has 30% women representation. In Migori County, women in flood-prone areas have formed self-help groups to build their resilience by de-silting the rivers and selling the sand to constructors.</li>\n<li><strong>Access to data</strong> on disasters, risks and weather information does <strong>not seem to be a key challenge</strong> in Kenya. The existence of various systems helps to address the existing data gaps; the challenge, however, is on the use of this data to inform decision-making.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Key recommendations</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Adopt a multi-stakeholder approach to promote the current draft of the disaster risk management law and develop a strategy with suitable timelines to build the political will among decision-makers and policy implementers to prioritise disaster preparedness.</li>\n<li>The Government of Kenya together with implementing agencies should develop standard operating procedures for the different types of natural disasters. Besides this, sensitisation and awareness will contribute to promoting preparedness culture</li>\n<li>An assessment of how the different financial instruments funding preparedness interact. These instruments would need to be promoted under a \u2018no-regrets\u2019 approach. Government and development partners should increase awareness of the ARC.</li>\n<li>County government officials should benefit from knowledge strengthening on: disaster and resilience measurement; climate change dynamics; modelling; disaster-response triggers and thresholds. This would typically fall under capacity building provided by UN agencies.</li>\n<li>Joining-up timely data from the national surveys with what NGOs and other non-state actors collect will help to make data and accessibility to data more interoperable and more up to date for use.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>View our\u00a0presentation\u00a0below for a summary of the\u00a0key findings of the report</h4>\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"629\" src=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1v3fFdJ5aLCeHiveUR_f3csozaKmHgFRZB2SHSEOAEcY/embed?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=60000\" width=\"800\"></iframe></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Assessment-of-Kenyas-preparedness-to-disasters-caused-by-natural-hazards_report_7th-February.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Download the full report here</strong></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Assessment-of-Kenyas-preparedness-to-disasters-caused-by-natural-hazards-briefing.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Download the briefing here</strong></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/dfid/6220146368/in/photolist-atDSNU-d1XcgY-dg4Xh5-aZNNog-aDNaA3-ay25k6-aDVDvR-oqdkWR-a48J2H-fzXn9M-oqhp6m-aJ8t7t-c3qsMQ-aJ9krv-7mLEna-o8ZSs1-c3qir9-fzXH2a-eaK2P5-o8ZTaJ-atfnMu-aJ96L6-aDJdep-ay4pmm-aDJmcv-fA1DVK-a32rKB-5Zoau7-o8ZZm9-aZNNHi-ay4MwG-aDJdDz-eLyoGE-atDSxE-f11nV-aasMMQ-ay4rWL-aZNPEH-ay4psb-aDJoLc-ay26oT-dgCFpB-aeCDkN-c3qftS-dtfg9V-c3qvgY-ay4qQ7-aDNc9y-a49AAb-3x7yii\" target=\"_blank\">Homepage image credit:\u00a0Marisol Grandon/Department for International Development</a></p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Long-term investments in a short-term world: Arguments for sustainable data", "authors": [], "format": "Discussion paper", "date": "25 Jan 2017", "description": "This discussion paper makes the case for the acceptance of key issues that are paramount in the struggle for sustainable development data", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/long-term-investments-in-a-short-term-world-arguments-for-sustainable-data/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"><p>This discussion paper makes the case for the acceptance of key issues that are paramount in the struggle for sustainable development data, looking in particular at civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) and community-based censuses.</p>\n</div><div class=\"p-t--1 p-b--1 m-b--1\" style=\"border-top:2px solid #f2f2f2; border-bottom:2px solid #f2f2f2;\">\n<div style=\"overflow:hidden;\">\n<div class=\"col-md-7\">\n<div><a class=\"btn btn--dark pdf-download\" ga-event-action=\"pdf-download\" ga-event-category=\"Download\" ga-event-label=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Long-term-investments-in-a-short-term-world.pdf\" ga-on=\"click\" href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Long-term-investments-in-a-short-term-world.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Long-term-investments-in-a-short-term-world\">\n<i class=\"p ss-pdf\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0 Long-term-investments-in-a-short-term-world\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"p ss-download\"></i>\n</a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div> Modal <div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"modal pdf-popup\">\n<div class=\"modal-dialog wide\">\n<div class=\"modal-body \">\n<div>\n<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"btn-close\" href=\"#\" id=\"close-pdf-modal\">\u00d7</a>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t          Can we contact you later to ask your opinion about the publication you just downloaded?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf yes, please leave your email below.

Photo \u00a9 Aisha Faquir/World Bank</em></p>\n<p><strong>Raj\u2019s demand for data and information</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\u201cBy being able to join different datasets, we are able to see gaps emerge between different groups and geographies. Analysis of such data allows us to better target our programme for those who need it the most, and it helps us ensure that disparities between subgroups and geography are mitigated for in our programme planning.\u201d</strong></p>\n<p>Aggregated national figures from the past two decades show that Nepal has made significant progress towards achieving the MDGs, particularly on health indicators such as rates of maternal mortality, HIV and AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. But despite this good progress at the national level, Raj and his team are aware from their fieldwork that there are significant disparities in health and nutrition, and that some communities are being left behind in the country\u2019s development. They want to ensure that the work of Save the Children and other organisations can affectively target these groups and ensure that Nepal\u2019s development is inclusive for all. For this, Raj needed to find out exactly who these groups were and where they could be found. He needed to dig beyond the national aggregates to find more detailed data on health and nutrition.</p>\n<p>But Raj discovered that he couldn\u2019t find the data he needed in one place. Instead the different indicators he was looking for to identify the marginalized populations were fragmented over different systems and reports. This included Nepal\u2019s Health Management Information System; the government\u2019s National Demographic and Health Survey; Maternal Morbidity and Mortality Survey; Living Standard Survey; and publications from <em>The Lancet</em> medical journal. To identify the marginalised groups, Raj needed to find a way to join these datasets up. Raj worked alongside teams from Care, Oxfam and ActionAid to develop an analytical methodology that could compare data from each of the sources and draw out analysis of groups experiencing lack of progress.</p>\n<p><strong>Examples of Raj\u2019s data use</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Using joined-up data to guide development interventions: </strong>Raj and his team collated the different datasets into a report that highlighted the population groups in need of development interventions. The report was distributed to both the Government of Nepal and to development actors to support the targeting of their development efforts towards the most marginalised groups.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Using joined-up data to inform government strategy</strong>: The joined up data assembled by Raj and his team also informed the development of a new national strategy by the Government of Nepal \u2013 the National Strategy for Reaching the Unreached to Reduce Health and Nutrition Inequalities in Nepal (2016\u20132030). Save the Children is now involved in developing this further and implementing the strategy.</li>\n<li><strong>Using disaggregated, joined-up data to identify populations most in need</strong>: Through disaggregating the different datasets Raj and his team were able to identify subsections of the Nepali population that had yet to meet certain health and nutrition indicators. They discovered, for example, that although maternal mortality had dramatically decreased from 850 deaths per 100,000 in 1990 to 229 per 100,000 in 2009, there was significant variance between groups \u2013 with the Terai, Madhesi and Dalit castes having much higher maternal mortality rates than the Brahman, Chhetri and Newar castes. This type of data enabled Save the Children to focus its Reaching the Unreachable programme in areas with high populations of disadvantaged socioeconomic groups, including the districts of Banke and Baitadi.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Challenges to Raj having better information</strong></p>\n<p>One of the major problems faced by Raj was the <strong>lack of up-to-date data</strong> that was available to him. Some of the data \u2013 such as from the Maternal Morbidity and Mortality Survey and the Living Standard Survey \u2013 was eight years old. This made it difficult to conclusively target and understand which socioeconomic groups now needed extra support in health and nutrition. Despite some datasets being eight years older than others, Raj and his team had to treat all the datasets equally when joining them together.</p>\n<p>Another problem was the <strong>lack of subnational disaggregation</strong> of the data. Most geographic results were based on the four broad developmental regions or the national level rather than the district, village or ward level. Without data disaggregation, Raj could not definitively target specific disadvantaged districts, villages or wards as it was difficult to conclusively join-up data with different levels of disaggregation. Different metadata categorisation of geographical areas in the datasets meant Raj\u2019s team had to manually check for discrepancies before joining-up the datasets.</p>\n<p>Most of the data that they used were <strong>not in machine-readable format</strong> and many of the official government PDF documents contained <strong>inconsistencies in the font</strong>. This made the work of analysing and reporting the results of the data time consuming as Raj and his team had to manually change the font in the PDFs and then enter the data into their own data systems.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Using-joined-up-data-to-target-health-and-nutrition-funding.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Download this case study</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Other case studies in this series</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/using-hydrological-data-to-reduce-disaster-risk-and-enhance-community-resilience-in-nepal/\" target=\"_blank\">Using hydrological data to reduce disaster risk and enhance community resilience in Nepal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/using-supply-chain-data-to-improve-the-quality-of-public-health-services-in-nepal/\" target=\"_blank\">Using supply-chain data to improve the quality of public health services in Nepal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/using-data-to-reduce-diseases-and-improve-healthcare-for-children-in-nepal/\" target=\"_blank\">Using data to reduce diseases, and improve healthcare, for children in Nepal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/using-agricultural-data-to-guide-governments-food-security-efforts-in-nepal/\" target=\"_blank\">Using agricultural data to guide government\u2019s food security efforts in Nepal</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Using hydrological data to reduce disaster risk and enhance community resilience in Nepal", "authors": [], "format": "Case study", "date": "20 Dec 2016", "description": "Regional training for a community-based flood early warning system, Lalitpur, Nepal.

Photo: ICIMOD, Kathmandu</em></p>\n<p><strong>Rajendra\u2019s demand for data and information</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\u201cWe need real-time data on flooding so we can issue early warnings to both communities at risk and disaster management authorities, so they are informed and prepared\u201d</strong></p>\n<p>Until 2009 the water levels of Nepal\u2019s rivers were gauged with the help of a measuring scale installed near the river edge. To monitor water levels this system required members of local disaster management committees to regularly visit the measuring scales. This manual process was not only time consuming but prevented the quick assessment essential for identifying the risk of flooding and landslides. As a member of Nepal\u2019s water-related Disaster Management Committee, Rajendra is responsible for monitoring disaster risk in all eight flood-prone river basins across Nepal. For this he needs real-time, reliable data on river water levels and rainfall. He needs this data to identify the risk of flooding and landslides so that he can send timely warnings to the communities at risk of being affected and to the rescue authorities to warn them of the need for immediate action. To address this need, the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology has installed a web-based telemetric system that provides real-time data collected through automatic sensors at hydrological stations built in river basins.</p>\n<p><strong>Examples of Rajendra\u2019s data use</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Using real-time data on water levels to enable flood early warning: </strong>The data from the web-based telemetric system overseen by Rajendra and his team has, in some government offices, been fed into an electronic display board. In 2012 when the water level in the Rapti River reached the warning threshold, the system transmitted data directly to the electronic board in the Rapti district government office and triggered an automatic siren. This notified district officers and members of the Disaster Management Committee to raise a public siren and inform the local community of the flood risk. Using inundation maps, Rajendra and his team were able to identify specific locations that were at risk and send alerts using mass SMS messages to the downstream communities before the flood reached them. Early flood alerts helped people to move out of the danger zones, along with their movable properties and valuables, to safer places.</li>\n<li><strong>Using web-based data to increase disaster response lead time: </strong>In June 2013 three days of heavy rainfall caused the Karnali river\u2019s water level to rise rapidly. By using real-time data from the web-based telemetric system, Rajendra and his team were able to monitor Karnali\u2019s water level and predict the extent of the rise. When the water level reached 9 metres Rajendra and his team were able to immediately notify the Bardiya district officials to sound the siren warning people to stay alert. And then as it rose to 10 metres they were able to inform the local community to prepare for evacuation. The real-time data allowed Rajendra and his team to predict that the water level would reach 11 metres, which provided the Nepal army and police force sufficient time to move the local community to a safer location.</li>\n<li><strong>Using real-time hydrological data to enable effective coordination: </strong>The web-based telemetric system links data automatically to a warning system in the Ministry of Home Affairs\u2019 National Emergency Operation Center. When the data indicates a rise in water level above a certain threshold the warning sirens turn on, enabling the Center to take quick action. Based on this information the Center is able to make decisions on how many rescue teams should be mobilised and where they should be targeted, allowing effective coordination between the Centre and the affected districts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Challenges to Rajendra having better information</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\u201cReal-time data is crucial for reducing disaster risks and saving lives but at times getting access to it is difficult due to theft of equipment and poor connections\u201d</strong></p>\n<p>Theft of the water censors installed besides river courses is the major problem for Rajendra and his team in collecting timely data. As well as being stolen, the censors are sometimes washed away by flood water. These have to be regularly replaced for Rajendra to be able to access location-specific timely data on water levels.</p>\n<p>Another challenge for Rajendra in accessing real-time data is the poor internet connectivity and weak communication network in the locations he works. This causes delays in the transfer of data from the hydrological stations to the web-based telemetric system. The delays in the receipt of the data risk the ability of the Disaster Management Committees to take quick and informed decisions in urgent circumstances.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Using-hydrological-data-to-reduce-disaster-risk-in-Nepal.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Download this case study</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Other case studies in this series</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/using-joined-up-datasets-to-improve-the-targeting-of-health-and-nutrition-funding-in-nepal/\" target=\"_blank\">Using joined-up datasets to improve the targeting of health and nutrition funding in Nepal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/using-supply-chain-data-to-improve-the-quality-of-public-health-services-in-nepal/\" target=\"_blank\">Using supply-chain data to improve the quality of public health services in Nepal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/using-data-to-reduce-diseases-and-improve-healthcare-for-children-in-nepal/\" target=\"_blank\">Using data to reduce diseases, and improve healthcare, for children in Nepal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/using-agricultural-data-to-guide-governments-food-security-efforts-in-nepal/\" target=\"_blank\">Using agricultural data to guide government\u2019s food security efforts in Nepal</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Using supply-chain data to improve the quality of public health services in Nepal", "authors": [], "format": "Case study", "date": "20 Dec 2016", "description": "Gyan\u2019s demand for data and information \"We use data to ensure balance in stock levels so that adequate health supplies and medicines are made accessible al", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/using-supply-chain-data-to-improve-the-quality-of-public-health-services-in-nepal/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"><p>Gyan Bahadur BC is a Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Officer at the Government of Nepal\u2019s Department of Health.

The lack of timely and reliable data on stocks of medical supplies caused problems for those making decisions on allocations and resulted in stock shortages and delays in supply. As one of these decision-makers, Gyan is responsible for allocating 206 health commodities including 70 types of medicines through a supply chain including central stores in Kathmandu and Pathalaiya, five regional medical stores and 75 district-level stores. For this he requires timely and accurate data on both current levels of stock and previous consumption patterns, so he can calculate the amounts that need to be purchased to meet the demand of the upcoming year.</p>\n<p>Recognising this need, the Department of Health set up an online logistics inventory management system to provide real-time data. Using the data from the online system Gyan is able to determine which district medical stores have more than five months\u2019 worth of supplies, which have nearly expired medicines, and which have run out of supplies. Gyan uses the data to determine the fluctuation in stock levels, helping him to coordinate resupply of medicines in regions and districts where there are urgent needs and ensure essential medicines and health supplies are available all year round.</p>\n<p><strong>Examples of Gyan\u2019s data use</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Using historical data to estimate demand for condoms:</strong> In 2010, a supplier contracted by the Ministry of Health for supplying condoms over a three-year period discontinued the contract specifying an increase in the cost of raw materials. Having received just 15.5 million condoms in the first shipment, the health facilities were faced with the risk of running out of condoms in no time. By using information from the online inventory system, Gyan and his team were able to identify how many condoms were needed until a new contractor was hired. Based on the numbers they took an immediate action to move stocks from district health centres to where there were urgent needs and placed an emergency order through a donor agency to prevent a country-wide condom stock-out.</li>\n<li><strong>Using stock-take data to identify areas of need: </strong>In 2014 a medical store in Butwal, Western Nepal, reported a shortfall of 25,000 bottles of Ringer lactate, which is used to treat cases of diarrheal disease. By looking at the inventory data Gyan and his team were quick to discover that regional medical stores in Biratnagar in Eastern Nepal had an overstock of the solution. By transferring the surplus stock they were able to meet the urgent needs of Butwal.</li>\n<li><strong>Using data to generate procurement reports that prevent shortages: </strong>Gyan\u2019s team analyses the data on health stocks and repackages it in quarterly situation reports for other divisions in the Department of Health \u2013 including the Family Health, Child Health, Epidemiology and Diseases Control Divisions. These reports inform their procurement decisions and have led to a reduction in health stock shortages, wastages and instances of overstock.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Challenges to Gyan having better information</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\u201cUnavailability of the internet, electricity backup and computer accessories in some districts are hindering the flow of information, making it difficult for us to carry out timely analysis and quick supply decision-makings\u201d.</strong></p>\n<p>Poor internet connectivity, electricity back-up and computer equipment in the some districts are a major challenge for Gyan and his team when trying to collect the data online. Not all medical stores at the district level are able to update their data on a regular basis due to internet problems. It is also difficult for Gyan to get accurate information from the district health facilities. Many health facilities still record their orders for stocks using a paper-based system as they do not yet have access to the online inventory management system. This data on the needs of health facilities cannot be recorded in the online inventory system until Gyan\u2019s team spends considerable time verifying the data: it takes the team almost three months to manually enter data from all the health facilities in the online inventory system, causing delays to the allocation process.</p>\n<p>The high turnover of staff in the medical stores in the districts is another challenge for Gyan. It takes time to train staff to operate the logistics inventory management system, and frequent transfers of fully-trained staff to other government positions have caused errors in data entry. The time taken to resolve these errors hinders the monitoring of health supplies, causing a delay in the generation of procurement reports and risking shortages and wastages.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Using-supply-chain-data-to-improve-public-health-in-Nepal.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Download this case study</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Other case studies in this series</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/using-joined-up-datasets-to-improve-the-targeting-of-health-and-nutrition-funding-in-nepal/\" target=\"_blank\">Using joined-up datasets to improve the targeting of health and nutrition funding in Nepal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/using-hydrological-data-to-reduce-disaster-risk-and-enhance-community-resilience-in-nepal/\" target=\"_blank\">Using hydrological data to reduce disaster risk and enhance community resilience in Nepal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/using-data-to-reduce-diseases-and-improve-healthcare-for-children-in-nepal/\" target=\"_blank\">Using data to reduce diseases, and improve healthcare, for children in Nepal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/using-agricultural-data-to-guide-governments-food-security-efforts-in-nepal/\" target=\"_blank\">Using agricultural data to guide government\u2019s food security efforts in Nepal</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Using data to reduce diseases, and improve healthcare, for children in Nepal", "authors": [], "format": "Case study", "date": "20 Dec 2016", "description": "Mukunda\u2019s demand for data and information \"We need data to determine vaccination needs and to know where to allocate our resources to ensure that every chi", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/using-data-to-reduce-diseases-and-improve-healthcare-for-children-in-nepal/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"><p>Mukunda Gautam is Chief of Immunization at the Child Health Division in Nepal\u2019s Department of Health Services.

For this, Mukunda needs to know which geographic locations experience a high incidence of disease, which diseases are prevalent, what time of year disease outbreaks usually occur, and which groups are affected by the diseases. He needs detailed data to help him identify communities at risk of disease so that he can target the government\u2019s immunisation interventions. To monitor the impact of the interventions he needs demographic data on the target population, data on vaccine coverage, and details of vaccine wastage. He also needs this data to help him to forecast annual vaccine needs throughout Nepal and make informed decisions about the vaccines\u2019 allocation. The data that he needs is collected on a regular basis by the disease surveillance teams at the Child Health Division when visiting district health facilities. This data is recorded in the government\u2019s Health Management Information System, which makes it accessible to a number of agencies in the government.</p>\n<p><strong>Examples of Mukunda\u2019s data use</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Using data to measure the occurrence of disease:</strong> In the 2000s, rigorous campaigns were run in Nepal to reduce death from measles by 50% from the 1995 figure. By analysing data from the Health Management Information System, Mukunda and his team discovered that while the number of reported cases of measles had significantly reduced, there were rising instances of rubella, which increased from 227 reported cases in 2007 to 1,275 cases in 2009. Following their analysis the team quickly introduced a combined measles and rubella vaccine for every child in Nepal.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Using data to track immunization schedules: </strong>In two of Nepal\u2019s districts \u2013 Palpa and Kanchanpur \u2013 an Electronic Immunization Registration System (EIRS) jointly developed by the Department of Health Services and the World Health Organization logs personal immunisation records. Since its implementation in 2015, almost 6,500 children have been registered in the system. Mukunda and his team have used this data to track which children need follow-up vaccinations and when. This has enabled them to send SMS reminders to the parents of the children to ensure they don\u2019t miss a vaccination dose.</li>\n<li><strong>Using data to measure the impact of immunisation programs: </strong>Mukunda analyses data on vaccine coverage to determine whether the immunisation programmes have achieved full or partial immunisation. His findings help him to measure the impact of those programmes and guide his decision on whether the campaigns to encourage vaccinations, run by volunteers on local radio and television, need to be increased.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Challenges to Mukunda having better information</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\u201cAccurate and complete data is required to reach every child; however; poor data has meant that many children are still vulnerable to preventable diseases\u201d</strong></p>\n<p>The temporary migration of families from hills to the Terai plains during winter alongside unexpected movements of people around the country has been a major challenge for Mukunda and his team when making estimates for immunisation needs. The lack of comprehensive recording of births at the village level has posed a barrier for Mukunda and his team. The exact population may be much larger than the projected population because many births are not registered. This means that, at times, the data on the size of the target population detailed in the Health Management Information System does not match the population size at the actual time of vaccination. In the past this has led to incorrect estimations of the number of vaccines and healthcare providers needed, and the size of the budget needed to organise a vaccination session. But most importantly this has presented a challenge to the goal of immunising every child and protecting them against preventable diseases.</p>\n<p>The manual entry and tabulation of data by officials at the district level and below is another problem for Mukunda and his team. District officials need to be trained in computer and data management to be able to use the Health Management Information System and for there to be consistency in data reporting from across the districts. This can lead to delays in the collection and transmission of the data needed for Mukunda\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Using-data-to-improve-child-health-care-in-Nepal.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Download this case study</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Other case studies in this series</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/using-joined-up-datasets-to-improve-the-targeting-of-health-and-nutrition-funding-in-nepal/\" target=\"_blank\">Using joined-up datasets to improve the targeting of health and nutrition funding in Nepal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/using-hydrological-data-to-reduce-disaster-risk-and-enhance-community-resilience-in-nepal/\" target=\"_blank\">Using hydrological data to reduce disaster risk and enhance community resilience in Nepal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/using-supply-chain-data-to-improve-the-quality-of-public-health-services-in-nepal/\" target=\"_blank\">Using supply-chain data to improve the quality of public health services in Nepal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/using-agricultural-data-to-guide-governments-food-security-efforts-in-nepal/\" target=\"_blank\">Using agricultural data to guide government\u2019s food security efforts in Nepal</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Using agricultural data to guide government\u2019s food security efforts in Nepal", "authors": [], "format": "Case study", "date": "20 Dec 2016", "description": "Santosh's demand for data and information \"We need a large variety of data for analysing the various dimensions of food security across the country and to", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/using-agricultural-data-to-guide-governments-food-security-efforts-in-nepal/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"><p>Santosh Raj Paudel is a Senior Agri-Economist and Chief of Monitoring and Evaluation at the Department of Agriculture, Nepal.

Minimising the risks of food shortages is an important job for the government. Santosh monitors food production on a regular basis so that the government is well informed and able to take necessary decisions to ensure food security. For this, Santosh needs to monitor the four dimensions of food security: food availability, access, use and stability. He needs access to a wide variety of data to do this, including data on crop production, food consumption, stocks of main staples such as rice and wheat flour in key markets, market prices of main staples, as well as data on climate, disease, migration and remittances and more. This data is collected by district officials on a three-monthly basis and stored in the Nepal Food Security Monitoring System \u2013 NeKSAP \u2013 established in collaboration with the World Food Programme.</p>\n<p><strong>Examples of Santosh\u2019s data use</strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Using data to measure food security status at district level: </strong>In July 2016 Santosh used data from NeKSAP to determine the level of food security in 74 districts. Using this data Santosh and his team classified 212 Village Development Committees (VDCs) in 13 districts as highly food insecure and estimated that roughly 430,000 people in those districts required food assistance. A further 376 VDCs in 26 districts were classified as moderately food insecure, indicating that households are able to meet minimum food needs but unable to afford some essential non-food expenditures without adopting coping strategies such as selling their household assets. These findings were compiled by Santosh\u2019s team into a tri-annual <em>Food Security Bulletin</em>. The Bulletin aims to inform the government of the severity of food insecurity in various parts of the country so an appropriate response can be tailored.</li>\n<li><strong>Using data to boost production of specific crops: </strong>To boost food production Santosh and his team have analysed data on agricultural land cover, climate, soil quality, crop export and import and more to determine which locations in Nepal are most suited for particular crops. The Nepal government has used these findings to consolidate farms into zones of differing size (10 hectares of land, 100 hectares, 500 hectares and 1,000 hectares) to coordinate the growing of crops and produce larger harvests. For example, Jhapa district has been earmarked as a zone for rice, Kavre district for potatoes, Bara district for fishery, Kaski district for vegetables, Dang district for maize, Jumla district for apples and Kailali district for wheat. A series of grants, subsidies and technical assistance are provided to these classified areas in an attempt to improve Nepal\u2019s agricultural self-reliance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Challenges to Santosh having better information</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\u201cSometimes all the data needed to analyse food security is not available for the same period of time, which makes it difficult to present accurate findings\u201d</strong></p>\n<p>Incomplete information is one of the challenges that Santosh faces while estimating the level of food security. Measuring food security status requires the analysis of a wide variety of data that directly and indirectly influences agricultural production. To effectively combine the data for cross analysis Santosh needs the datasets to have similar timeframes, which unfortunately is not always possible. This means that Santosh has to base his forecasts on data from the previous year, which does not give completely accurate results.</p>\n<p>The long time frame for collecting data is another problem for Santosh. Data from the districts is collected every three months, but Santosh finds that this does not allow him to carry out up-to-date analysis in situations where an immediate response may be necessary. Ideally he would like to see agricultural data being collected with the help of the Global Positioning System (GPS). This would enable access to real-time data through satellite transfers. It would also allow Santosh and his team to cross check data collected through field surveys with satellite data for more accuracy.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Using-agricultural-data-for-food-security-in-Nepal.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Download this case study</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Other case studies in this series</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/using-joined-up-datasets-to-improve-the-targeting-of-health-and-nutrition-funding-in-nepal/\" target=\"_blank\">Using joined-up datasets to improve the targeting of health and nutrition funding in Nepal </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/using-hydrological-data-to-reduce-disaster-risk-and-enhance-community-resilience-in-nepal/\" target=\"_blank\">Using hydrological data to reduce disaster risk and enhance community resilience in Nepal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/using-supply-chain-data-to-improve-the-quality-of-public-health-services-in-nepal/\" target=\"_blank\">Using supply-chain data to improve the quality of public health services in Nepal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/using-data-to-reduce-diseases-and-improve-healthcare-for-children-in-nepal/\" target=\"_blank\">Using data to reduce diseases, and improve healthcare, for children in Nepal</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Metadata for open data portals", "authors": ["Beata Lisowska"], "format": "Discussion paper", "date": "15 Dec 2016", "description": "This paper investigates how open data portals share their metadata and explores the most prevalent underlying metadata standards used.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/metadata-open-data-portals/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"><p>A recent\u00a0<a href=\"https://livestream.com/BIFTV/ODI\" target=\"_blank\">Open Data Institute (ODI) summit in London</a>\u00a0featured a number of talks where a range of stakeholders discussed open data: how important it is, how it unleashes the true potential of data, what it means, what possibilities if offers, and where the future of the open data lies.

That information should be found in the metadata that should couple the data published.</p>\n<p>Metadata is, in essence, structured information that makes it easier to retrieve, use or manage an information resource. In practice, metadata describes a dataset and its structure, and helps users discover it. The information usually includes such basic elements as: title, who published the dataset, when it was published, how often it is updated and what license is associated with the dataset. These are classed as \u2018descriptive metadata\u2019 as opposed to \u2018structural metadata\u2019, which describes for example information on page layout or an object\u2019s component and their relationships (such as chapters or tables in a book).</p>\n<p>This paper investigates how open data portals share their metadata and explores the most prevalent underlying metadata standards used. It seeks to understand to what extent the metadata standards used by the predominant open data platforms are interoperable.

It draws from country-level evidence, including the Development Finance Assessments that countries in the region have undertaken. Six core features of financing frameworks that help develop long-term, holistic strategies to link financing with sustainable development results are identified. These six features can form the building blocks of the integrated national financing framework:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/An-INFF-for-delivering-national-development-priorities-and-the-SDGs.jpg\"><img alt=\"an-inff-for-delivering-national-development-priorities-and-the-sdgs\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-11965 size-full\" height=\"798\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1230px) 100vw, 1230px\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/An-INFF-for-delivering-national-development-priorities-and-the-SDGs.jpg\" srcset=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/An-INFF-for-delivering-national-development-priorities-and-the-SDGs.jpg 1230w, http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/An-INFF-for-delivering-national-development-priorities-and-the-SDGs-768x498.jpg 768w\" width=\"1230\"/></a></p>\n<h4></h4>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Leadership that facilitates institutional coherence</strong> is essential for bringing together actors across and outside government to build an integrated approach and ensuring alignment in policies.</li>\n<li><strong>A clear vision for results</strong> that the country wants to achieve is the foundation of an integrated national financing framework on which financing plans and targets are built.</li>\n<li><strong>A strategic financing policy</strong> takes the long-term vision for results and develops estimates for the costs and types of investments needed. It provides a broad framework within which operational financing policies that mobilise the outputs leading to sustainable development impacts can be developed.</li>\n<li><strong>Specific financing policies</strong> develop and deliver plans to mobilise each type of finance in a scale and manner consistent with the strategic financing policy. This covers a range of policies such as medium-term expenditure frameworks, tax revenue strategies, national aid policies and industrial development strategies.</li>\n<li><strong>A strong monitoring, evaluation and learning system</strong> is an essential ingredient of results-focused planning and implementation.</li>\n<li><strong>An enabling environment for accountability and dialogue</strong> is essential to build the trust necessary to mobilise contributions from stakeholders outside government; make sure policies are being designed and delivered effectively; and ensure a voice for citizens, civil society, business, development partners and other actors.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The beginning of the SDG era is an important moment for governments to assess their financing frameworks and consider how effectively they can shape and deliver financing policy for the future. The concept of an integrated national financing framework can help as a prompt to reflect on the strengths and weaknesses of existing financing frameworks as a whole, and a guide as governments undertake reforms. Indeed, a number of Asia-Pacific countries are already taking steps towards establishing an integrated national financing framework.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.asia-pacific.undp.org/content/rbap/en/home/library/democratic_governance/achieving-the-sustainable-development-goals.html\" target=\"_blank\">Download the report from the AP-DEF website here</a></p>\n<h3><strong>About AP-DEF</strong></h3>\n<p>This report was commissioned by AP-DEF through financial support from the Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation.</p>\n<p>The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)\u2019s Bangkok Regional Hub is the Secretariat for AP-DEF, a country-led regional platform, chaired by the Government of Bangladesh, which supports Asia-Pacific countries to implement their national agendas on development finance and cooperation.</p>\n<p>Contact AP-DEF, UNDP Bangkok Regional Hub:</p>\n<p>Thomas Beloe: <a href=\"mailto:Thomas.beloe@undp.org\">Thomas.beloe@undp.org</a></p>\n<p>Ashley Palmer: <a href=\"mailto:Ashley.palmer@undp.org\">Ashley.palmer@undp.org</a></p>\n<p>Emily Davis: <a href=\"mailto:Emily.davis@undp.org\">Emily.davis@undp.org</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "How can Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) be used to address the needs of databases?", "authors": ["Beata Lisowska"], "format": "Discussion paper", "date": "23 Nov 2016", "description": "This paper aims to find a practical approach to applying DCAT to satisfy the needs of a portal that provides dynamic visualisations & a database that drives it.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/can-data-catalog-vocabulary-dcat-used-address-needs-databases/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"><p>The\u00a0<a href=\"http://data.devinit.org/#!/\">Development Data Hub</a>\u00a0is an example of one of many visualisation tools available on the web that aim to make data more accessible, easy to disaggregate and comparable in an intuitive way.

However, the discussion about blending has been based on very little evidence to date. Before scaling up investments in this area we need a much better understanding of the current role and the future potential of blended finance and the comparative advantages for ending poverty in relation to other possible uses of official development assistance (ODA), such as traditional grants and loans.</p>\n<p>In this report we analyse the available data on blended finance, beginning to build the evidence base that is needed to inform decisions on its future use. We look at what the data can tell us about the potential of blended finance for financing the SDGs and the associated risks, opportunities and possible benefits for developing countries.</p>\n<p><strong>Key findings</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The current amount of private sector investment to developing countries as a result of blended finance is small compared with other financial flows; however, it is growing and there appears to be potential for significant future growth, though not the trillions needed to finance the SDGs.</li>\n<li>Private investments mobilised through blended finance are currently higher in middle-income countries and developing countries with lower levels of poverty; however, it seems more likely than foreign direct investment to be invested in poorer countries.</li>\n<li>Private capital mobilised through blended finance is most likely to be invested in infrastructure and the productive sectors.</li>\n<li>Data and information on blended finance is of varying quality and needs to be improved; for example, it is currently not possible to say how much ODA is being used to support blended finance.</li>\n<li>Improved transparency of blended finance is critical to ensure that donors and their partner countries can better understand its impact on poverty.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The guiding principle for donors should be that the role of ODA in blended finance increases available resources for targeting poverty, rather than pursuing private investment through blending as an end in its own right.</li>\n<li>Donors must carefully consider and discuss with their partner countries the most appropriate use of ODA for blending; this is particularly pertinent with the ongoing modernisation of ODA, which could incentivise donors to scale up their use of blended finance instruments in some of the poorest and most fragile developing countries.</li>\n<li>Crucially, for blended finance to work for Agenda 2030, we need improved transparency and better data on where it is going and how, and on its impact.</li>\n<li>A common standard of reporting needs to be established for all providers using blended finance instruments. The International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) Standard could be used as the basis for reporting since many actors are already using it to report on their development spending.</li>\n<li>There is a need for open dialogue between relevant stakeholders to establish how to improve qualitative aspects of reporting.</li>\n<li>Since data and evidence are currently insufficient to inform decision-making, providers should be active in calling for improved evidence and should be cautious in scaling up blending until better data becomes available.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>View our\u00a0presentation\u00a0below for a summary of the\u00a0key findings of the report</h4>\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"629\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Lb7zhgyYAVGpJeb3Px2YLiFqf8lAgYfN8Z9t74UqT18/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=60000\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"800\"></iframe></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Blended-finance-Understanding-its-potential-for-Agenda-2030.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Download the full report here</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/di-kicks-off-project-on-blended-public%E2%88%92private-finance-for-development\" target=\"_blank\">Find out more about our work on blended finance here</a></p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Climate finance and poverty: Exploring the linkages between climate change and poverty evident in the provision and distribution of international public climate finance", "authors": [], "format": "Report", "date": "15 Nov 2016", "description": "Climate change is among the greatest global development challenges of the 21st century.

From the global to the local scale, climate change affects and threatens economic and human development. It risks undermining efforts towards sustainable development, including progress on ending poverty, everywhere and in all its forms. The links between climate change and poverty are recognised in global processes, including the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement on climate change. But how far are these links recognised in the distribution of international public climate finance?</p>\n<p><strong>Key findings</strong></p>\n<p>We estimate that the total amount of international public climate finance flowing to developing countries in 2014 was US$48.9 billion. Increases in support from development finance institutions and in the proportion of official development assistance (ODA) targeted towards climate change suggests the links between climate change and poverty are recognised.</p>\n<p>But links between climate and poverty are not reflected in the allocations of climate finance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Just under half of the global population living in extreme poverty is located in countries vulnerable to climate change. Despite this, allocations of adaptation finance do not prioritise the countries most vulnerable to its impacts: in 2014 total adaptation approvals were greatest to the 49 countries with mid-range vulnerability scores. Some of the most vulnerable countries such as Eritrea, Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone and Liberia received particularly little.</li>\n<li>The 14 countries with the deepest levels of poverty (over 20%) received among the lowest amounts of total adaptation finance \u2013 a 2014 average of US$56 million per country, compared with an average of US$73 million in 67 countries with poverty depths of less than 5%. Support was especially low to Micronesia, Lesotho and Togo.</li>\n<li>Countries with the highest vulnerability to climate change and the lowest domestic revenues to build capacity to respond receive some of the smallest amounts of adaptation finance.</li>\n<li>While mitigation finance is distributed fairly proportionately against patterns of greenhouse gas emissions, support is lacking to a number of countries with significant mitigation needs and relatively few domestic resources, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nigeria, which are also home to high populations of extremely poor people.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The report highlights that the limited adaptation resources available are not being distributed where needs are greatest. It argues that such assessments should inform future decisions on allocating of climate finance and other resources, particularly ODA. It also asserts that, while mitigation finance does not have a mandate to target people in poverty, it is vital that mitigation strategies are developed with an acute awareness of their impact on poor populations.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the report calls for better data on both resources provided and their impacts, and the distribution of poverty and vulnerability. This would aid better understanding of the comparative advantages of the multitude of climate finance mechanisms and programming. Greater visibility on all climate finance is also needed to better inform tracking efforts, and hold donors\u2019 existing and future financing commitments to account.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Development-Initiatives-Climate-Finance-report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full report</a></p>\n<p>Homepage image credit:\u00a0Gian Betancourt/CIAT</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Why was IODC2016 important for Joined-Up Data Standards?", "authors": [], "format": "Report", "date": "08 Nov 2016", "description": "In July this year we launched a\u00a0consultation paper\u00a0aimed at starting a discussion on what technical and political solutions to joined-up data challenges co", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/15744/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"><p>This report was\u00a0authored by Tom Orrell, Senior Advocacy Adviser at\u00a0<a class=\"js-track-clicks\" href=\"http://www.publishwhatyoufund.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Publish What You Fund</a>\u00a0\u2013 our partners on the\u00a0<a class=\"js-track-clicks\" href=\"http://juds.joinedupdata.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Joined-Up Data Standards project</a></p>\n</div><div class=\"p-t--1 p-b--1 m-b--1\" style=\"border-top:2px solid #f2f2f2; border-bottom:2px solid #f2f2f2;\">\n<div style=\"overflow:hidden;\">\n<div class=\"col-md-7\">\n<div><a class=\"btn btn--dark pdf-download\" ga-event-action=\"pdf-download\" ga-event-category=\"Download\" ga-event-label=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IODC2016-Joined-up-Data-Standards-evidence-of-need-and-emerging-solutions.pdf\" ga-on=\"click\" href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IODC2016-Joined-up-Data-Standards-evidence-of-need-and-emerging-solutions.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"IODC2016 Joined-up Data Standards - evidence of need and emerging solutions\">\n<i class=\"p ss-pdf\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0 IODC2016 Joined-up Data Standards - evidence of need and emerging solutions\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"p ss-download\"></i>\n</a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div> Modal <div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"modal pdf-popup\">\n<div class=\"modal-dialog wide\">\n<div class=\"modal-body \">\n<div>\n<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"btn-close\" href=\"#\" id=\"close-pdf-modal\">\u00d7</a>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t          Can we contact you later to ask your opinion about the publication you just downloaded?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf yes, please leave your email below.

The study\u2019s aims were simple: explore whether communities can assess and identify their own local development priorities using the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and help them to generate timely and accurate data that feeds into local and national development intervention plans. This would help ensure the SDGs are met for their community, and that the data is available and accessible in an open format through <a href=\"http://www.lanet.opencounty.org\" target=\"_blank\">Lanet Open County</a> portal.</p>\n<p>The study is due for completion in October 2016 but already it makes a strong case for the benefits of community-generated data. Two rounds of data collection covering 9,136 households have shown that this local approach is more cost-effective in collecting census data. Furthermore, the method used in this exercise demonstrates the value of collecting SDG data based on local interpretations of the Global Goals, making them more relevant to people\u2019s aspirations for social progress. Just ten months in and already the project has led to improved buy-in to the Global Goals \u2013 a better understanding of what they are and how they can be useful as a planning and participatory tool. The project has already led to tangible changes in people\u2019s lives \u2013 with Lanet Umoja residents drinking and cooking with clean water for the first time.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The community generated data on number of households and household sizes is real data, not based on a sample survey of households in the wider population.</li>\n<li>Household budget data is recent and collected by knowledgeable residents, who can better cross-check the responses to expenditure module of the report. This serves to reduce reporting errors on key aspects of the survey. Household expenditure structure is not extrapolated from a large sample: rather, it is built bottom-up from the collected data as reported by each individual household. By cross-referencing with a real dependency ratio calculated from this data, consumption per capita makes more sense than when calculated across a large population using inferences based on average household sizes.</li>\n<li>Overall, the database from this exercise can be built overtime to capture real social progress \u2013 in access to basic social services, for instance \u2013 and a measure of improvements to living standards in the long run.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Read our\u00a0<a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Using-community-generated-data-to-deliver-and-track-the-Sustainable-Development-Goals-at-the-local-level_DI_Case-study.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">case study</a> in full</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Displacement, Democratic Republic of the Congo", "authors": [], "format": "Crisis briefing", "date": "28 Sep 2016", "description": "On 28 September 2016 we responded to a funding alert for the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), raised in response to the high number of South Sudanes", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/displacement-democratic-republic-of-the-congo-2/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"p-t--1 p-b--1 m-b--1\" style=\"border-top:2px solid #f2f2f2; border-bottom:2px solid #f2f2f2;\">\n<div style=\"overflow:hidden;\">\n<div class=\"col-md-7\">\n<div><a class=\"btn btn--dark pdf-download\" ga-event-action=\"pdf-download\" ga-event-category=\"Download\" ga-event-label=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/START-briefing-DRC-September-2016-1.pdf\" ga-on=\"click\" href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/START-briefing-DRC-September-2016-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"START-briefing-DRC-September-2016\">\n<i class=\"p ss-pdf\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0 START-briefing-DRC-September-2016\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"p ss-download\"></i>\n</a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div> Modal <div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"modal pdf-popup\">\n<div class=\"modal-dialog wide\">\n<div class=\"modal-body \">\n<div>\n<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"btn-close\" href=\"#\" id=\"close-pdf-modal\">\u00d7</a>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t          Can we contact you later to ask your opinion about the publication you just downloaded?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf yes, please leave your email below.

Rising levels of forced displacement drive increased\u00a0emergency financing requirements</h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Forced-displacement-poverty-and-financing-fig.-1.png\"><img alt=\"Forced displacement, poverty and financing fig. 1\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11645\" height=\"569\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Forced-displacement-poverty-and-financing-fig.-1.png\" width=\"1570\"/></a></p>\n<h5>Number of regional refugee response plans (RRPs) against\u00a0numbers of people forcibly displaced, 2012\u20132016 [1]</h5>\n<p>Global forced displacement continues to rise, reaching a record 65.3 million people in 2015 \u2013 an increase of 5.8 million people from 2014. The 2015\u00a0figure includes 21.3 million refugees, 40.8 million internally displaced persons (IDPs), and 3.2 million asylum seekers.[2]</p>\n<p>At the same time, both the number of UN-coordinated appeals and the funding requirements set out within them have risen significantly since 2013, driven largely by major conflicts and complex\u00a0emergencies that have displaced many millions of people \u2013 Syria, South Sudan, Yemen and Iraq among them. In 2013 there were 23 appeals requesting a\u00a0total of US$13.2 billion, compared to 37 appeals requesting a total of US$20.2 billion so far in 2016. See also <a href=\"http://devinit.org/?p=10803\" target=\"_blank\">Global Humanitarian Assistance Report 2016, Chapter 3</a>.</p>\n<p>While the needs of many refugees and IDPs are included in country-specific appeals, since 2013 RRPs have set out multi-country approaches to refugee\u00a0flows stemming from the same conflict. The Syria Regional Refugee and Resilience Response Plan remains by far the largest, requesting US$4.5 billion\u00a0alone so far in 2016, with five others in 2016 covering displacement from Burundi, Central Africa Republic, Nigeria, South Sudan and Yemen.</p>\n<p>But annual appeals and short-term humanitarian funding cycles are clearly ill-suited to addressing the protracted nature of most displacement and the\u00a0longer-term livelihood needs of refugees and their host communities. The Syria 3RP is multi-year and has a resilience focus in response to the protracted\u00a0nature of displacement. To support host countries in meeting the immediate and long-term needs of refugees, new longer-term and development financing\u00a0mechanisms are also beginning to emerge. (see Figure 3 and 7).</p>\n<p>The domestic contributions of host countries are also essential. Protecting refugees is primarily the responsibility of states, yet their contributions are hard to measure, particularly as national and\u00a0local budgets may be difficult to access and assistance cuts across multiple budget lines.</p>\n<h3>Where people are displaced</h3>\n<h4>2. Most displaced people globally are in the Middle East and Africa</h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Forced-displacement-poverty-and-financing-fig.-2.png\"><img alt=\"Forced displacement, poverty and financing fig. 2\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11646\" height=\"573\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Forced-displacement-poverty-and-financing-fig.-2.png\" width=\"1626\"/></a></p>\n<h5>The number of people displaced by region of host country, 2006\u20132015 [3]</h5>\n<p>Over one-third of displaced people \u2013 refugees, asylum seekers and IDPs \u2013 were living in the Middle East and North of Sahara in 2015 (37%), and a further\u00a0quarter (27%) in the South of Sahara region. So, while the number of refugees and asylum seekers in Europe has risen sharply recently (from 4.9 million people\u00a0in 2014 to almost 7.6 million in 2015), this represented 12% of the displaced population globally \u2013 with most displaced people still in the Middle East and Africa.\u00a0See <a href=\"http://devinit.org/?p=10803\" target=\"_blank\">Global Humanitarian Assistance Report 2016, Chapter 1</a> for more details.</p>\n<h3>The wealth of countries hosting the largest numbers of refugees</h3>\n<h4>3. There are more displaced people in middle income than in low or high income countries</h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Forced-displacement-poverty-and-financing-fig.-3.png\"><img alt=\"Forced displacement, poverty and financing fig. 3\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11647\" height=\"580\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Forced-displacement-poverty-and-financing-fig.-3.png\" width=\"1456\"/></a></p>\n<h5>Number of displaced people by income\u00a0group of host country, 2006\u22122015 [4]</h5>\n<p>There continue to be more displaced\u00a0people in middle income countries (MICs)\u00a0than in low income countries \u2013 with\u00a0the smallest proportion in high income\u00a0countries. Lower middle income countries\u00a0accounted for a large proportion of the total in the MIC group (52%). Although\u00a0country income levels are wide groupings\u00a0and a crude indicator of poverty and\u00a0coping capacity, they can determine the\u00a0kind of aid a country can access, with the\u00a0World Bank\u2019s previously applied income\u00a0criteria making most MICs ineligible for\u00a0concessional loans. The rising number of\u00a0displaced people in MICs as a result of\u00a0the conflict in the Middle East and North\u00a0of Sahara, particularly in Syria, is impelling\u00a0a rethink of these financing instruments\u00a0(See Figure 7).</p>\n<h4>4. Many countries hosting the most refugees\u00a0have low domestic revenues</h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Forced-displacement-poverty-and-financing-fig.-4.png\"><img alt=\"Forced displacement, poverty and financing fig. 4\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11648\" height=\"797\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Forced-displacement-poverty-and-financing-fig.-4.png\" width=\"1249\"/></a></p>\n<h5>Number of refugees/asylum seekers hosted against non-grant government revenue for the<br/>\n20 countries hosting the most refugees and asylum seekers [5]</h5>\n<p>In 2015, Jordan hosted the largest number of refugees and asylum seekers (2.81 million, mostly from Palestine and Syria), followed by Turkey (2.75 million, mostly from Syria) and Pakistan (1.57 million, mostly from Afghanistan).[6] Although the largest numbers of displaced people are in middle income\u00a0rather than low income countries, many of the countries that host the largest numbers of refugees and asylum seekers generally do not have the highest levels of domestic revenues, and the available national resources to respond are low. For example, Pakistan hosted the third largest numbers of refugees in 2015, but\u00a0had a non-grant revenue of US$208 per capita. Sweden in contrast hosted a fifth of the number of refugees and asylum seekers as Pakistan that same year, but had revenues 116 times higher (US$24,124 per capita). In Turkey, the figure stood at US$3,400.</p>\n<h3>Understanding the poverty of refugees</h3>\n<h4>5. National poverty surveys in countries hosting the most refugees are largely out of date</h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Forced-displacement-poverty-and-financing-fig.-5.png\"><img alt=\"Forced displacement, poverty and financing fig. 5\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-11649\" height=\"700\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Forced-displacement-poverty-and-financing-fig.-5.png\" width=\"499\"/></a></p>\n<h5>Year of most recent poverty survey in\u00a020 countries hosting the highest numbers of refugees [7]</h5>\n<p>Understanding the levels of poverty in refugee-hosting countries is important to know the impact on host communities and to be able to appropriately address\u00a0needs within a development framework rather than in emergency response cycles. However, as per currently available data, only 10 of the 20 countries hosting\u00a0the largest numbers of refugees have conducted internationally comparable national poverty surveys in the last five years (since 2011), and some \u2013 Lebanon\u00a0and South Sudan \u2013 have never had internationally comparable surveys. For most countries, the poverty and crisis context has changed dramatically since\u00a0the latest national poverty survey was undertaken, meaning that there is a lack of up-to-date information on people\u2019s needs, undermining the potential to plan\u00a0appropriate support and target available resources effectively. And while poverty data on host communities is limited, data on poverty among refugee populations in\u00a0these countries is even more challenging (see Figure 6).</p>\n<h4>6. Refugees are not systematically included in national poverty surveys and development frameworks</h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Forced-displacement-poverty-and-financing-fig.-6.png\"><img alt=\"Forced displacement, poverty and financing fig. 6\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11650\" height=\"768\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Forced-displacement-poverty-and-financing-fig.-6.png\" width=\"1355\"/></a></p>\n<h5>Inclusion of refugees in the most recent internationally comparable poverty surveys in 20 countries hosting the highest numbers of refugees, 2015 [8]</h5>\n<p>*Countries that did not count those refugees in camps.</p>\n<p>Most refugee situations are protracted and it is estimated that on average, refugees are displaced for 17 years.[9] Yet, little is known about the poverty of refugees in their host communities as they are not systematically included in national poverty surveys. So the longer term\u00a0livelihood needs of refugees are not addressed through national development planning. Instead, these are left to be counted in humanitarian terms and therefore funded through shorter-term emergency assistance. Better data on the poverty of refugees is critical to ensuring\u00a0that they are not \u2018left behind\u2019 in action to meet the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>\n<p>Of the 20 countries hosting the most refugees in 2015, only 7 included refugees in their most recent internationally comparable national poverty survey. Of these, five countries only included refugees living in\u00a0permanent residences outside camps, and hence the surveys do not provide a complete picture of the longer-term livelihood needs of all refugees. What counts as a \u2018permanent residence\u2019 outside of camps is often not stated in methodological documents, making it\u00a0difficult to compare between countries, and risking excluding refugees residing outside camps but not on a \u2018permanent\u2019 basis. For poverty surveys undertaken in seven of the countries, whether or not refugees had been included was not explicitly stated in methodologies. There is a need for a clearer and more systematic approach to including refugees in poverty surveys.</p>\n<p>In the absence of such national survey data, other studies are beginning to give a picture of refugees\u2019 poverty, to understand their long-term needs and the economic opportunities and development support required. The first poverty and welfare assessment by the World Bank and UN High Commissioner for Refugees\u00a0of a refugee population took place in 2014\u20132015 in Jordan and Lebanon, using an approach that can be adapted for other countries.

Short term emergency responses alone are not sufficient: a wider repertoire of international financing instruments is needed to support refugees, their host communities and national authorities</h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Forced-displacement-poverty-and-financing-fig.-7.png\"><img alt=\"Forced displacement, poverty and financing fig. 7\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11651\" height=\"829\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Forced-displacement-poverty-and-financing-fig.-7.png\" width=\"1620\"/></a></p>\n<h5>Modalities and instruments of international financing support to refugees [10]</h5>\n<p>While refugee responses in places needing international support largely rely on funding from humanitarian grants, this is beginning to change in recognition that emergency cycles are not adequate or sustainable. Greater global responsibility sharing in response to rising levels of displacement[11] includes deploying a more tailored and diverse set of financing instruments to support host countries to meet the immediate and long-term needs of<br/>\nrefugees. An understanding of the existing and emerging mechanisms and resources available in any given context needs to underpin an effective response.</p>\n<p>Multilateral development banks (MDBs) are playing an emerging role in establishing new funding mechanisms to support host countries. At the World Humanitarian Summit, a group of MDBs came together to set out a range of commitments and practical measures to respond to forced displacement.[12] The World Bank\u2019s recently announced global crisis response platform intends to provide resources for risk mitigation and crisis response to low and middle income countries, including access to long-term, low-interest loans,[13] with a particular focus on large refugee-hosting countries.</p>\n<p>Within the new MENA (Middle East and North Africa) Financing Initiative, launched jointly by the World Bank Group, the UN and the Islamic Development Bank Group, eight governments and the European Commission pledged a package of over US$1 billion of concessional finance to support countries hosting Syria refugees.[14]\u00a0It includes guarantees for the issuance of a special type of sukuk (Islamic bond) administered by the Islamic Development Bank Group.</p>\n<p>While seeking to support host governments, financing mechanisms also need to build on the capacities of communities, and enable opportunities for refugees. A number of recent studies have evidenced the actual and potential economic contribution of refugees in their host countries, rather than the costs related\u00a0to hosting them.[15]</p>\n<p>Photo credit: EC/ECHO</p>\n</div><div class=\"row--cards\" ng-if=\"post.notes\">\n<div class=\"col-md-12 card m-b--2\">\n<div class=\"card__content bg--light\">\n<h3 class=\"h3\">Notes</h3>\n<div> <p>[1]\u00a0Source: Development Initiatives based on UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs Financial Tracking Service;\u00a0Notes: Total number of displaced people includes \u2018refugees and people in refugee-like situations\u2019, asylum seekers (pending cases)\u2019\u00a0and \u2018internally displaced people protected/assisted by UNHCR\u2019.

Canada, Germany, Australia and France are estimated to provide between US$1 billion and US$1.4 billion of private development assistance annually. Five countries are estimated to provide less than US$100 million. It is important to note that countries with more comprehensive data on private development assistance from different providers, including foundations and corporations engaging in philanthropic activities, will appear more generous.</p>\n<h3>NGOs are the largest providers of private development assistance</h3>\n<p>For 18 out of the 24 countries for which private development assistance estimates are available, data can be disaggregated by different types of providers \u2013 such as NGOs, foundations and corporations engaging in philanthropic activities. Estimates suggest that NGOs are the largest providers of private development assistance, contributing 53% of the total US$44.6 billion (although more data is available on NGOs than on foundations or corporate spending, which is likely to skew findings).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Private-development-assistance-key-facts-and-global-estimates_Fig-3.jpg\"><img alt=\"Private development assistance key facts and global estimates_Fig 3\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11558\" height=\"468\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Private-development-assistance-key-facts-and-global-estimates_Fig-3.jpg\" width=\"912\"/></a></p>\n<p>According to the available data, corporations provided an estimated 20% or US$8.8 billion and foundations provided 16% or US$7.2 billion (of which US$6.6 billion was from US foundations). Some 11% of private development assistance was classified as \u201cunspecified\u201d since data could not be disaggregated by provider type, for example in the case of OECD net private grants data.</p>\n<h3>Private development assistance from large organisations is comparable to ODA from some goverment donors</h3>\n<p>The largest NGOs and foundations channel private development assistance comparable to the spending of some government donors and collect private income comparable to the national revenues of some developing countries. For example, if the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation was a government donor, it would be the 12th largest among DAC countries. Its US$2.5 billion disbursements to developing countries are US$234 million greater than bilateral ODA from Denmark, and only US$7 million lower than disbursements from Switzerland. Taking income, that collected by Medecins Sans Frontieres in 2013 was over eight times larger than national non-grant revenues of the Central African Republic.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Private-development-assistance-key-facts-and-global-estimates_Fig-4a.jpg\"><img alt=\"Private development assistance key facts and global estimates_Fig 4a\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11559\" height=\"511\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Private-development-assistance-key-facts-and-global-estimates_Fig-4a.jpg\" width=\"897\"/></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Private-development-assistance-key-facts-and-global-estimates_Fig-4b.jpg\"><img alt=\"Private development assistance key facts and global estimates_Fig 4b\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11560\" height=\"472\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Private-development-assistance-key-facts-and-global-estimates_Fig-4b.jpg\" width=\"921\"/></a></p>\n<h3>Tracking trends in private development assistance: a recent stagnation?</h3>\n<p>OECD data on net private grants[6] provides insights into trends in private development assistance volumes. The data suggests that while total levels were rising between 2005 and 2010, they stagnated between 2010 and 2012 and have decreased since. However, this is to be interpreted with care as lack of consistent reporting may be skewing overall trends.[7]</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Private-development-assistance-key-facts-and-global-estimates_Fig-5.jpg\"><img alt=\"Private development assistance key facts and global estimates_Fig 5\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11561\" height=\"404\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Private-development-assistance-key-facts-and-global-estimates_Fig-5.jpg\" width=\"925\"/></a></p>\n<p>The data also shows that global private development assistance trends are closely related to recorded changes in US figures \u2013 this is not surprising since private development assistance from the US accounts for over two-thirds of the total. A <a href=\"http://charity.org/sites/default/files/userfiles/pdfs/Assessment%20of%20US%20Giving%20to%20International%20Causes%20FINAL.pdf\">2013 assessment of US giving to international causes</a> suggests that the recent stagnation in private development assistance levels is due to slow economic recovery after the financial crisis and higher contributions to local communities rather than to international efforts. Similarly, in the UK, the <a href=\"https://www.cafonline.org/about-us/publications/2015-publications/uk-giving-2014\">Charities Aid Foundation</a> suggests that confidence in the UK has still not fully recovered following the financial crisis and private individuals are more likely to spend extra disposable income on holidays and personal items than on donating to charity.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/report/gha-report-2015\">Global Humanitarian Assistance Report 2015</a> and a <a href=\"http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/report/humanitarian-assistance-non-state-donors\">recent briefing paper on humanitarian assistance from non-state donors</a> provide further insight into private giving trends. Although related specifically to giving in response to crises, findings corroborate broader private development assistance trends. They suggest that private donors tend to respond more generously to rapid onset and natural disasters than to chronic and conflict-related crises. In fact, although private giving in the humanitarian sector has risen year-on-year since 2012, it has done so at a much slower pace than has humanitarian assistance from governments \u2013 one possible explanation being that most humanitarian crises in 2013 and 2014 were chronic or conflict-related.[8]</p>\n<h3>The share of ODA through NGOs is constant while the volume is increasing</h3>\n<p>In addition to private funding, NGOs also receive ODA from DAC governments. ODA is received both as aid channelled through NGOs where donors have control over the outcome of their money, and ODA given as core support to NGOs where donors do not manage how their money will be invested.[9]</p>\n<p>The share of ODA channelled through NGOs has remained relatively constant between 2008 and 2013, averaging 16% of the total.[10] Approximately 3% of ODA from DAC donors has been going to NGOs as core support over the same period. While the shares of ODA to and through NGOs have remained consistent, the volume of ODA channelled through NGOs has increased alongside the rise in total ODA. Total bilateral ODA from DAC donors has risen from US$102 billion in 2008 to US$110 billion in 2013. ODA channelled through NGOs has risen from US$14.0 billion to US$17.6 billion in the same years. Core support \u2013 a small part of total ODA \u2013 has remained unchanged at around US$3 billion.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Private-development-assistance-key-facts-and-global-estimates_Fig-6.png\"><img alt=\"Private development assistance key facts and global estimates_Fig 6\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11562\" height=\"775\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Private-development-assistance-key-facts-and-global-estimates_Fig-6.png\" width=\"1616\"/></a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>An incomplete picture of private organisations\u2019 contributions to development</h3>\n<p>Unlike ODA, estimating private development assistance presents multiple challenges caused by data gaps and a lack of methodological standardisation for defining private development assistance within and across countries.</p>\n<p>With no comprehensive mechanism for capturing private development assistance, estimates are compiled from a variety of sources including the OECD\u2019s \u2018net private grants\u2019 data, national sources for particular countries and indexes such as those compiled by the Center for Global Prosperity.</p>\n<p>In addition to limitations in measuring global private development assistance, disaggregated data is also lacking thus making it difficult to analyse how, when, where, by who and on what this type of resource is spent. Disaggregated data by source and by expenditure in recipient countries, including at sub-national level and by sector, is not systematically available. Shortcomings with the data mean that the estimates we have are not comprehensive enough to be precise figures. This lack of accurate data presents a significant constraint on our ability to understand and evaluate the impact, comparative strengths and role that private development assistance actors should play in the Sustainable Development Goals era.</p>\n<p>Photo credit: Eddy Mbuyi/Oxfam, January 2013</p>\n</div><div class=\"row--cards\" ng-if=\"post.notes\">\n<div class=\"col-md-12 card m-b--2\">\n<div class=\"card__content bg--light\">\n<h3 class=\"h3\">Notes</h3>\n<div> <p>[1] DAC member countries for which data on private development assistance is available.

Following on from the agreement of the \u2018<a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/eplibrary/New-Deal-for-engagement-in-fragile-states.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States\u2019</a> at the Fourth High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Busan in 2011, which recognised the need to take a different approach in fragile states and to address peace and security as a prerequisite for sustainable development, commitments to address fragility through development assistance have continued to gather pace. The inclusion of Global Goal 16 on \u2018inclusive and peaceful societies\u2019 in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the mandate to look beyond aid to include much broader sources of finance is a clear example of this. Furthermore, the recent reports of the United National Secretary General (UNSG) for the World Humanitarian Summit (WHS)[1] and of the UN High Level Panel on Humanitarian Financing[2] call for a greater proportion of aid to be targeted towards situations of fragility.</p>\n<p>To effectively measure the delivery of these commitments and ensure that assistance in fragile states meets the needs of the most vulnerable people, there is a pressing need for data. Data on poor and vulnerable people is critical for ensuring that available resources are targeted effectively. Data on the domestic capacity to address poverty and vulnerability, the different international resource flows, together with evidence on the different funding mechanisms used, is important for identifying where the funding gaps are and how to strengthen the effectiveness of the response.</p>\n<p>Yet, the collection of such data is particularly challenging in fragile and conflict-affected countries where domestic capacities are low and access to affected areas is constrained as a result of conflict and insecurity. This makes it difficult for donors and governments to make coordinated and needs-based decisions on how to effectively allocate finite resources.</p>\n<p>This report seeks to scope the availability of such data and evidence in one fragile state, Somalia, and to provide an overview of what this data tells us, where it exists. The aim of the report is to draw lessons for future application in other fragile contexts, highlight challenges, identify areas where further research could be undertaken, and make recommendations for strengthening the availability and quality of data.</p>\n<p>The report is structured around the following five key sections: a background to the context in Somalia; an overview of the availability of data at national and subnational levels on both poverty and vulnerability; an overview of the availability of data at subnational and national levels on domestic and international resource flows (aid and beyond); analysis of the various funding mechanisms in operation, drawing key lessons; and recommendations for where further research could be undertaken and how data gaps could be addressed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Somalia-an-overview-of-poverty-vulnerability-and-financing.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Download the report</a></p>\n<p class=\"truncate\" id=\"yui_3_16_0_1_1470136459370_3475\">\u00a0Photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/icrc/8248659223/in/photolist-dyUx1t-paxLEt-paxuzo-pawFbM-pawr8N-pawDk2-paw6Sn-pawY79-aDVPR8-pawx3c-inptDW-opMkDF-mCEPDv-aDVTMZ-aDZLth-ppZExw-pawvt1-fPJjRP-ps2FQV-JPeQgR-JPeMZX-JPeY2a-HSV2qK-JEbitf-JLe6w1-AJjTz6-HSUQ4M-aDZJkq-aDZH87-aDZKVU-aDVR1p-aDVQnM-aDZHCw-aDVNZB-aDVSAk-aDZKcJ-cwg1BY-aDZMdq-aDZGrG-aDZJTo-JPeLZR-BeBnM9-HSWrAN-GQcVXu-Gk7msk-Gk7mic-Gk7m7v-Gk7myx-GQcWao-JEb9fA\" target=\"_blank\">International Committee of the Red Cross</a></p>\n<div class=\"view follow-view\" id=\"yui_3_16_0_1_1470136459370_1963\"></div>\n</div><div class=\"row--cards\" ng-if=\"post.notes\">\n<div class=\"col-md-12 card m-b--2\">\n<div class=\"card__content bg--light\">\n<h3 class=\"h3\">Notes</h3>\n<div> <p>[1] Report of the UN Secretary General (2015), One Humanity: Shared Responsibility Report of the Secretary-General for the World Humanitarian Summit (<a href=\"http://refugeesmigrants.un.org/sites/default/files/in_safety_and_dignity_-_addressing_large_movements_of_refugees_and_migrants.pdf\">http://refugeesmigrants.un.org/sites/default/files/in_safety_and_dignity_-_addressing_large_movements_of_refugees_and_migrants.pdf</a>).</p>\n<p>[2]\u00a0 UN High Level Panel on Humanitarian Financing (2015), Too Important to Fail.

For this ambition to be met, we need to know who the poorest people in the world are, understand their lives, and ensure they are included in progress.\u00a0The <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/page/p20i\" target=\"_blank\">P20 Initiative</a> is a project focusing on the people who are in the poorest 20% globally. It aims to track their progress and improve information about their lives in order to ensure no one is left behind in efforts to tackle poverty. This briefing focuses on health.</p>\n<p>The state of maternal and child health (itself a measure of a functioning health system) is fundamental to the progress for the P20. Data that allows us to pinpoint those being left behind is limited, but that which exists show that the P20 are at a disadvantage.</p>\n<p>Agenda 2030 is about fighting poverty and making meaningful progress across key sectors. In order to \u2018leave no one behind, we have to know who is included in progress in each sector \u2013 and who is left out.</p>\n<p>Improved health is fundamental, but the data used to measure progress under Agenda 2030 focuses on national prevalence; it does not identify the people or places in greatest need. Data on maternal mortality is not comprised of headcounts but rather is modeled using GDP per capita, fertility rates and skilled birth attendance.\u00a0 These averages make it impossible to identify who is benefitting from progress.</p>\n<p>Survey data tells a bit more about who benefits. In the P20, just 36% of all children had a skilled birth attendant present at birth \u2013 compared with 74% in the rest of the population. (Skilled birth attendants can reduce infant mortality by 43%[1] and prevent two-thirds of all maternal deaths.)[2]</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/One-3rd-of-children-in-P20-had-skilled-attendant-at-birth1.jpg\"><img alt=\"One 3rd of children in P20 had skilled attendant at birth\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-11397\" height=\"423\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/One-3rd-of-children-in-P20-had-skilled-attendant-at-birth1.jpg\" width=\"298\"/></a></p>\n<p>Survey data has also revealed that women in the P20 are three times as likely to have had a sister who has died in childbirth than women in the rest of the population.</p>\n<p>The P20 Initiative will monitor the progress on health outcomes and on the disaggregated data that can enable policies and resources to be targeted to those furthest behind. It will support the Sustainable Development Indicators for Goal 3 on maternal and under-five mortality.</p>\n<h4>Explore further P20 briefings on:</h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/p20-civil-registration-and-vital-statistics-briefing\" target=\"_blank\">Civil Registration Systems and Vital Statistics</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/p20-education-briefing\" target=\"_blank\">Education</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/p20-gender-briefing\" target=\"_blank\">Gender and identity</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/p20-income-briefing\" target=\"_blank\">Income</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/p20-nutrition\" target=\"_blank\">Nutrition</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</div><div class=\"row--cards\" ng-if=\"post.notes\">\n<div class=\"col-md-12 card m-b--2\">\n<div class=\"card__content bg--light\">\n<h3 class=\"h3\">Notes</h3>\n<div> <p>Quote: One Illness Away: Why People Become Poor and How they Escape Poverty, Anirudh Krishna</p>\n<p>[1] Ending Newborn Deaths: Ensuring Every Baby Survives.

But most discussions of progress focus on aggregated economic numbers such as gross domestic product (GDP) growth, not on the status of people. Even key measures about people such as GDP per capita are aggregated to the point that they can\u2019t meaningfully say if people are being left behind or not.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/The-P20-methods-for-tracking-the-status-of-people-in-the-poorest1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">our background paper</a> we describe a methodology that looks at existing indicators on people to track the status of the most vulnerable. Instead of looking at specific poverty lines, we focus on the progress of the group of people who are most likely to be left behind. Over the next 15 years, we will track progress of people in the poorest 20% globally, which we call the P20. By focusing on the conditions of a fifth of the world\u2019s population, we will have a continuously applicable measure of inclusion, regardless of poverty lines.</p>\n<p>This paper describes the status of existing data sources such as the World Bank\u2019s PovcalNet, USAID\u2019s Demographic and Health Survey, and UNICEF\u2019s Multiple Indicators Cluster Survey. These surveys have the potential to highlight trends in the status of the P20. An analysis of the limits of these sources also highlights the need for better and more data to track the status of the P20.</p>\n<p>We find that there are methods that can provide valuable insights about the gender, age, and subnational locations of people who are in households in the P20. However, much more needs to be done to look at intra-household dynamics and identify who is most vulnerable.</p>\n</div><div class=\"row--cards\" ng-if=\"post.notes\">\n<div class=\"col-md-12 card m-b--2\">\n<div class=\"card__content bg--light\">\n<h3 class=\"h3\">Notes</h3>\n<div> <p>Photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/ihhinsaniyardimvakfi/7029146865/in/photolist-bH9dtk-buer2Y-bH9dKp-bH9ebg-bH9dfB-bueqEG-buepY9-aRTGpi-aRi3V4-aQJX4M-aRi4Gz-aRi2Sz-aQK9dg-aRTKEt-aRUgBi-aRTs6a-aQK7yT-aRi1gc-aRUmv6-aRTR8P-aRicEX-aRiaUX-aRToTc-aRijB4-aRi8iH-aRi9g2-aRidS6-aRTccB-aRTnGz-aRTgT4-aRTdZK-aDZSTj-aDZS8j-aDZSY9-aRTTKz-aRTVWP-aQKcC4-aRUjUB-aRUvg6-aRTLSR-aRhX6H-aQKaWa-aQKeoB-aRV23H-aRTyuZ-aRTwv6-aQK2M6-aQJZDR-aRUpYD-aRhYF8\" target=\"_blank\">IHH Humanitarian Relief Foundation</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"}, {"title": "P20: Gender and identity", "authors": [], "format": "Briefing", "date": "19 Jul 2016", "description": "Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals have brought us a global commitment to end extreme poverty and ensure no one is left behind.

It aims to track their progress and improve information about their lives in order to ensure no one is left behind in efforts to tackle poverty. This briefing focuses in on gender.</p>\n<p>Some of the poorest people are disadvantaged more than others due to their gender or identity. For example, women and girls have been, and remain, disadvantaged in many areas \u00a0\u0336 \u00a0what they earn, the work they do, their ownership of property, chances of schooling and of being heard. And the exclusion suffered by the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community is becoming increasingly evident.</p>\n<p>Ending poverty in all its forms and leaving no one behind means ensuring that someone\u2019s gender or other aspect of their identity never leaves them in poverty or causes them to suffer discrimination or exclusion.</p>\n<p>More timely, gender-disaggregated data means we can measure whether the poorest women and girls, \u00a0the many young men without employment and opportunity, and people at risk of exclusion as a result of gender identity or sexuality are being listened to, reached with services and sharing in growth.</p>\n<p>The chart below illustrates just how critical it is to have disaggregated data. It shows the significant gap between the numbers of women and men who have completed primary education. It also shows that both girls and boys in the P20 are much less likely to complete primary school than the rest of the population. The disaggregated data we have for education is not available for most other sectors. Data disaggregated by\u00a0age\u00a0and gender means we can get a better picture of who is and isn\u2019t getting access to services and opportunity. Disaggregation by geography means services can then be targeted to those people who need them most.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Sex-disaggegated-data-shows-gap-beween-women-and-men-who-completed-primary-ed.jpg\"><img alt=\"Sex disaggegated data shows gap beween women and men who completed primary ed\" class=\"wp-image-11346 aligncenter\" height=\"465\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Sex-disaggegated-data-shows-gap-beween-women-and-men-who-completed-primary-ed.jpg\" width=\"298\"/></a></p>\n<p>Surveys that measure wealth at the household level often mask disparities between people within a household. Not everyone has equal access to family resources \u2013 women, older or disabled people are often bypassed. And just as within households poverty can be invisible, within communities and countries some of the poorest people can be excluded from surveys because of some aspect of their identity or because they are not living in households but are either homeless or in an institution.\u00a0 The challenge for the Data Revolution is to deliver \u2013 at a minimum \u2013 data on all people disaggregated by income quintile, geography, gender, age and disability (QGGAD). That data can underpin efforts to empower women and support policies that target other people who are held back from progress.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/page/p20i\" target=\"_blank\">Read more about our P20 Initiative</a></p>\n<h4>Explore further P20 briefings on:</h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/p20-civil-registration-and-vital-statistics-briefing\" target=\"_blank\">Civil Registration Systems and Vital Statistics</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/p20-education-briefing\" target=\"_blank\">Education</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/p20-health-briefing\" target=\"_blank\">Health</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/p20-income-briefing\" target=\"_blank\">Income</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/p20-nutrition\" target=\"_blank\">Nutrition</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</div><div class=\"row--cards\" ng-if=\"post.notes\">\n<div class=\"col-md-12 card m-b--2\">\n<div class=\"card__content bg--light\">\n<h3 class=\"h3\">Notes</h3>\n<div> <p>Sources: PovcalNet, Demographic and Health Surveys, Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys, China Family Panel Survey, Pesquisa Nacional de Demografia e Saude as of July 1, 2016.

Donors are already pledging to scale up their efforts to use aid in blended finance partnerships with private actors.</p>\n<p>We therefore need to improve the evidence base on blended finance, which is currently very limited, to ensure it can reach its full potential in financing the 2030 Agenda and that its impacts are understood, transparent and accountable.</p>\n<p>This paper sets out 10 key questions we intend to answer on blended finance.

Examples of GPGs include climate change mitigation, communicable disease prevention and global peace and security.</p>\n<p>ODA is well positioned to play a role as a funding source for certain GPGs; its main objective is to promote the economic development and welfare of developing countries, enabling it to be targeted towards funding specific GPGs. However, ODA is increasingly recognised as a scarce and precious resource with competing demands, attention is therefore turning to questioning the role development cooperation should play in providing GPGs.</p>\n<p>This discussion paper takes a first step, outlining an analytical approach to assessing ODA for GPGs. It profiles ODA\u2019s role in providing GPGs and highlights the difficulties of measurement. It finds that better defining GPG investments and better understanding of how ODA currently supports these investments are essential first tasks in informing the debate around appropriate uses of ODA.</p>\n<p>This paper identifies eight broad themes under which ODA can be directed to GPGs: environment, global public health, research, trade policy and transport policy, conflict peace and security, communications, humanitarian international non-governmental organisations and other. Each broad theme contains one or more sub-themes, and the sub-themes are <em>why</em> any particular activity is included as a GPG (for example, communicable disease prevention is categorised as a sub-theme, is the basis for selection as a GPG, and sits under the global public health theme).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc454310361\"></a>Key findings on ODA to GPGs in 2014</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>ODA disbursements directed to GPGs stood at US$12.9 billion in 2014. This is 8% of total ODA.</li>\n<li>The largest three broad GPG themes were <strong>environment</strong> (US$8.0 billion), <strong>global public</strong> <strong>health</strong> (US$2.1 billion) and <strong>other</strong> <strong>(ie non-health/non-environment) research</strong> (US$1.1 billion).</li>\n<li><strong>Disbursements to the environment theme made up 62% (US$8.0 billion) of total ODA to GPGs in 2014</strong>. A significant proportion of this (over 80%) comprises activities marked to have a principal policy focus on climate change mitigation. These figures are likely to be an underestimate because they do not capture mitigation financing activities in the form of disbursements from a number of multilateral development banks. <strong>Total GPG ODA marked as research activities stood at US$2 billion in 2014, </strong>with US$516 million in global public health and US$315 million in environment. A quarter of estimated global public health GPG spending relates to research that is non-country specific.</li>\n<li>The largest channel of delivery for GPGs in 2014 was <strong>public sector institutions</strong> (US$5.7 billion in total). <strong>Multilateral organisations</strong> were the second largest channel of delivery at US$2.8 billion, of which US$1.2 billion was channelled through the <strong>UN</strong> and US$1.0 billion through the <strong>World Bank</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Measuring-aid-to-global-public-goods-GPGs-Discussion-paper-July-2016.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Download the full discussion paper here</a></p>\n<p>Hompage image \u00a9 2008, Getty Images for International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI)</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Food insecurity in Kenya", "authors": [], "format": "Crisis briefing", "date": "13 Jul 2016", "description": "On 12 July 2016 we responded to a funding alert raised due to food insecurity in Kenya.

National budgets have often featured poverty reduction and/or welfare improvement as an explicit or implied objective during this period \u2013 hence the concept of pro-poor budgeting. However, the concept of budgets targeted at reducing poverty remains an area of debate, despite having a two-decade-long history. Much of the evidence informing assessments of the pro-poor orientation of budgets was gained when the concept was fairly new and focused mainly on spending.</p>\n<p>There is more to the pro-poor orientation of a budget than the spending it sets out. This paper proposes a framework of five components to consider while assessing budgets targeted at reducing poverty, and applies four of these components to Uganda\u2019s fiscal year 2015/16 and 2016/17 budgets. With more than half (63%) of the Ugandan population categorised as either poor or vulnerable to poverty, and yet limited evidence to suggest that public spending is properly targeting the poor and vulnerable, Uganda makes an ideal case study.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Pro-poor-orientation-of-budgets-The-case-of-Uganda.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Download the briefing paper here</a></p>\n<p>Homepage image credit: Joseph Miti</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "What do we learn from studies on aid allocation to the health sector?", "authors": ["Karen Rono", "Rob Tew"], "format": "Report", "date": "05 Jul 2016", "description": "Top findings ODA to health (including both general health, population policies/programmes and reproductive health) more than doubled in real terms between", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/what-do-we-learn-from-studies-on-aid-allocation-to-the-health-sector/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"><p>Our report unpacks studies that have been carried out on official development assistance (ODA; commonly known as aid) to the health sector.

Although total ODA disbursements to health rose in real terms in most years since 2005, the proportion of ODA going to the health sector has remained fairly constant at between 12% and 14% each year since 2007.</p>\n<p>Many studies on aid to health seem to be driven by the need to inform global processes and forums such as the Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation. These tend to assess the qualitative side of aid (aid effectiveness). The extent to which these studies have influenced decisions requires more inquiry.</p>\n<p>There are many more studies on aid allocation to HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and nutrition than there are on other illnesses that are equally prevalent, such as the neglected tropical diseases, or on health subsectors such as human resources for health.</p>\n<p>China (a non-DAC donor) appears among the top 10 donors to health in Africa; however the analysis on the volume of the non-DAC funding and its potential to close the health funding gaps (particularly on health infrastructure and systems, which are the sub-sectors that receive less of DAC funding) is disproportionately small.</p>\n<p>Access to studies on aid to health is also a key limitation. There exist peer-reviewed studies (which we would regard as high quality) but not all of these are published in journals fully accessible to the public. It is therefore unclear what capacity these studies have for changing the delivery of aid to the health sector.</p>\n<p>The regularity of studies on aid analysis could be improved.

These have become increasingly similar but each contains unique, useful modules. Our research finds that two-thirds of the questions in the two most widely used surveys are either identical or similar enough to be practically comparable.</p>\n<p>This presents developing countries with a dilemma. Do they, at great expense, commission multiple surveys, or do they accept that they cannot afford to collect all the data they require?</p>\n<p>There are two ways to solve the problem of competing standards: combine them into one, or establish functional links between them. We argue that the interests of developing countries would be best served by the integration of the three programmes, and that until this is possible it is critical that data from different surveys is capable of being joined up.</p>\n<p>Over the past 18 months, the problems of duplication and the lack of interoperability and comparability \u2013 between surveys, datasets, countries and over time \u2013 have been recognised by the global statistical community in general, and by the three lead institutions in particular.

On the revenue side, pro-poor budgeting relies more on progressive taxation. The level to which a country\u2019s budget is pro-poor can be measured by the extent to which it aligns with the country\u2019s poverty reduction strategy, plans and commitments.</p>\n<p>This briefing paper assess the pro-poorness of Kenya\u2019s 2016/17 budget, touching on revenue mobilisation; it also considers allocation to deficit financing and debt servicing, as well as to specific sectors and programmes, namely health, education, agriculture, social protection, rural electrification and irrigation in arid and semi-arid areas.</p>\n<p>In 2016/17, the Government of Kenya plans to spend Ksh 2.3 trillion (30.6% of GDP), the highest budget ever for the country and the largest in the East African region; it estimates it will collect Ksh 1.5 trillion (20.3% of GDP), a 16% nominal increase from fiscal year 2015/16. Fiscal deficit is estimated to be between 6.9% and 9.3% of GDP. The plan to borrow increasingly from the domestic market might push the interest rate higher \u2013 thereby crowding out the private sector and dampening domestic economic activities to the detriment of the poor (in the short-term, at least). On the other hand, 23% of the total proposed budget has been locked for debt servicing, of which 53.8% will be in the form of interest repayments, indicating that the country is increasingly borrowing on short-term concessions and/or on high-interest, non-concessional loans.</p>\n<p>The levels of overall revenue collection as well as new sources of taxation have been improving over time. The progressiveness of Kenya\u2019s revenue collection is evident in the share of direct tax in GDP, which is higher than the mean for lower middle-income countries; however, the increase in excise duty on kerosene and the road maintence levy are expected to put further pressure on the poor.</p>\n<p>Our analysis on allocation to education indicates that the sector remains one of the country\u2019s priorities. While most allocations (55%) are targeted towards teacher management, pupil\u2013teacher ratios differ across the counties.</p>\n<p>Regarding health, despite an increase in budget allocations for national health programmes over time, the country seems certain to miss its 2017 target for reduction in maternal, infant and child mortality rates.</p>\n<p>Budgetary allocation to expand irrigation projects for food security in arid and semi-arid land areas has been reduced for 2016/17, but more information is needed to conclude whether the country is on track against its own targets.</p>\n<p>The budget for the National Safety Net Programme has increased by 537% between 2012/13 and 2016/17, even though this year\u2019s budget has declined by 1%. It has so far managed to reach 5% of people living below $1.90 a day, particularly older persons, orphaned and vulnerable children, and people living with disabilities.</p>\n<p>A success story on pro-poor allocation is the rural electrification programme, whose budget almost doubled between 2014/15 and 2016/17, connecting nearly 95% of public schools and benefiting households around these schools.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, there is commendable progress in meeting the Second Medium Term Plan 2013\u20132017 targets in some sectors, but there is need for the country to ensure that this progress is cascaded down to the county level.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Towards-pro-poor-budgeting-Kenya\u2019s-budget-allocations-Briefing-report-June-2016.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Download the briefing paper</a></p>\n<p>Homepage photo credit: Living Goods</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Yellow fever, the Democratic Republic of the Congo", "authors": [], "format": "Crisis briefing", "date": "23 Jun 2016", "description": "On 23 June 2016 we responded to a funding alert raised due to an outbreak of yellow fever, affecting the provinces of Kinshasa, Kongo Central and Kwango in", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/yellow-fever-the-democratic-republic-of-the-congo/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"p-t--1 p-b--1 m-b--1\" style=\"border-top:2px solid #f2f2f2; border-bottom:2px solid #f2f2f2;\">\n<div style=\"overflow:hidden;\">\n<div class=\"col-md-7\">\n<div><a class=\"btn btn--dark pdf-download\" ga-event-action=\"pdf-download\" ga-event-category=\"Download\" ga-event-label=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/START-briefing-DRC-yellow-fever-June-2016-1.pdf\" ga-on=\"click\" href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/START-briefing-DRC-yellow-fever-June-2016-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"START-briefing-DRC-yellow-fever-June-2016\">\n<i class=\"p ss-pdf\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0 START-briefing-DRC-yellow-fever-June-2016\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"p ss-download\"></i>\n</a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div> Modal <div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"modal pdf-popup\">\n<div class=\"modal-dialog wide\">\n<div class=\"modal-body \">\n<div>\n<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"btn-close\" href=\"#\" id=\"close-pdf-modal\">\u00d7</a>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t          Can we contact you later to ask your opinion about the publication you just downloaded?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf yes, please leave your email below.

This study assesses the readiness of the Ugandan national statistical system \u2013 an ecosystem that includes both official and non-governmental producers and users of data \u2013 to meet these challenges.</p>\n<p>We have designed a database to capture and classify key attributes about data producers, data sources and data sets. We have conducted research to identify 92 organisations that produce 1,150 unique datasets published in 300 unique documents or platforms.\u00a0The inventory is currently available as a <a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Uganda-Data-Ecosystem-Inventory.xlsx\" target=\"_blank\">downloadable Excel file</a> and an <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TCTYJoZKDkxOOBCne6RinsXCqDCLlQwf0_wPxdU2YGQ/edit\" target=\"_blank\">online workbook</a>.</p>\n<p>We have classified these datasets by type of publisher, sector, timeliness and frequency of production, by provenance, geographic scope and level of disaggregation, method of collection, and accessibility. We hope to refine this methodology to contribute to a collaborative, generic methodology that can be used for all countries.</p>\n<p>Our analysis of all 1,150 datasets using this methodology is, in this first part of the study, purely quantitative. We make no attempt at this stage to identify which of these datasets is more important than another. This will be the main focus of the second part of the study.</p>\n<p>Based on timeliness and disaggregation criteria we find 59 high-quality datasets produced by 13 separate institutions. We find the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) well placed to build on its existing strengths to lead a data revolution for sustainable data.</p>\n<p>We find that the biggest challenges facing the national statistical system lie in the production of more timely, disaggregated data.</p>\n<p>We find that the biggest obstacle facing UBOS and the data ecosystem in general is insufficient financial investment from both domestic and external sources.</p>\n<h3>Key findings</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The multi-stakeholder national statistical system in Uganda, led by UBOS, is in a very healthy position to press forward with a data revolution that will play a key role in delivering Uganda\u2019s Vision 2040 and Africa\u2019s Agenda 2063 while also meeting as best it can the shorter-term demands of the global 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Best practice</strong>: primary datasets in Uganda by publisher and sector that are disaggregated (to district or lower), timely (published since 2014) and accessible (public and online)</h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Uganda-ROAD-data-producers.jpg\"><img alt=\"Uganda ROAD data producers\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-10735 size-full\" height=\"748\" sizes=\"(max-width: 885px) 100vw, 885px\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Uganda-ROAD-data-producers.jpg\" srcset=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Uganda-ROAD-data-producers.jpg 885w, http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Uganda-ROAD-data-producers-120x100.jpg 120w\" width=\"885\"/></a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is more remarkable is that Uganda\u2019s statistical progress has been achieved despite a debilitating lack of financial investment and support that has a direct impact on the human and technological capacity available and on operational ambitions. The excellent Community Information System \u2013 which requires more funding to extend its scope from 47 to all 112 districts \u2013 is facing retrenchment due to a lack of investment.</li>\n<li>A lack of investment is also the major reason for slow progress in developing a functioning civil registration and vital statistics system.

The leap is also explained by a rise in funding to security sector reform, which quadrupled between 2007 and 2008 (up US$787 million).</p>\n<h4 class=\"Figureandtableheading\">Figure 1: CPS ODA 2005\u20132014</h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Aid-spending-on-CPS_Fig-1.png\"><img alt=\"Aid spending on CPS_Fig 1\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-10671 size-full\" height=\"685\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Aid-spending-on-CPS_Fig-1.png\" width=\"976\"/></a></p>\n<p><em>Source: </em>OECD Creditor Reporting System (CRS) online database</p>\n<h3>Where does it come from?</h3>\n<h4>Figure 2: Largest providers of CPS ODA, 2014</h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Aid-spending-on-CPS_Fig-2.png\"><img alt=\"Aid spending on CPS_Fig 2\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-10672 size-full\" height=\"739\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Aid-spending-on-CPS_Fig-2.png\" width=\"978\"/></a></p>\n<p><em>Source</em>: DI calculations based on CRS online database and CRS 2014 download<br/>\n<em>Notes</em>:\u00a0 IDA: International Development Association; UNDP: United Nations Development Programme.</p>\n<p>The largest CPS ODA donor in 2014 was EU institutions, providing contributions totalling US$0.62 billion \u2013 almost one-fifth of all CPS ODA.

(US$ figures throughout are 2014 constant prices.)</li>\n<li><strong>22 of the 28 DAC countries reported a real-terms increase in ODA</strong>: The largest increase in ODA in monetary terms came from Germany \u2013 a rise of US$4.3 billion, or 26%. This meant Germany overtook the UK as the second largest donor after the US. The largest percentage increases were from Greece (39%) and Sweden (37%).</li>\n<li><strong>Most of the rise in ODA was due to increased spending on refugees within donor countries</strong>: ODA targeted on the sustenance of refugees housed in donor countries rose from US$6.6 billion in 2014 to US$13.9 billion in 2015 \u2013 by far the largest figure ever recorded. European donors most strongly affected by the ongoing refugee crisis showed large proportional increases in their total ODA between 2014 and 2015.</li>\n<li><strong>However ODA excluding refugee costs also rose</strong>: When spending on refugees in donor countries is subtracted from the total, the remaining ODA also showed an increase of US$2.2 billion or 1.7%.</li>\n<li><strong>The US reduced ODA disbursements significantly</strong>: Total ODA from the US fell by US$2.3 billion, a reduction of over 7% compared with 2014. Australia also continued its recent trend of cutting ODA, recording a real-terms decrease for the 3rd straight year \u2013 Australian ODA is now almost US$900 million below its 2012 peak.</li>\n<li><strong>Six DAC donors now meet 0.7% (up from five in 2014)</strong>: Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Luxembourg and the UK all maintained ODA above the UN 0.7% of gross national income (GNI) target.

The current lack of systems for reporting or monitoring aid for domestic revenue mobilisation means that even basic questions, such as how much is spent, where and how, are difficult to answer. Without this information it is difficult to monitor and evaluate results and ensure that new commitments drive measurable outcomes.</p>\n<p>Key recommendations emerging from the report include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Improve reporting:</strong> create a specific purpose code for domestic revenue mobilisation within systems for reporting ODA expenditure through the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and International Aid Transparency (IATI) standard. Donors already report detailed information through these systems and adding a purpose code would introduce a simple framework for them to identify relevant projects.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Focus on results:</strong> use growing clarity about what is being spent as a basis for enhanced knowledge sharing and understanding results. Any monitoring systems established should enable qualitative analysis of outcomes as well as monitoring inputs and promoting lesson learning. Donors report project information they should be encouraged to retrospectively detail the types of tax systems they have helped partner countries create, the amounts of revenue mobilised and the specific taxes they have helped to establish or improve.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Enhance progressive and sustainable revenue mobilisation</strong><strong>:</strong> more information, gained through improved reporting, should contribute to increased dialogue and better understanding of how aid for domestic revenue mobilisation can strengthen the design and implementation of progressive, sustainable tax policies and revenue mobilisation.

The imperative to address fragility, conflict and insecurity has become a central focus of global development processes. This has culminated in the inclusion of Global Goal 16 on \u2018inclusive and peaceful societies\u2019 in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the mandate to look beyond aid to include much broader sources of finance. It is important to therefore understand the current financing landscape for peace and security and identify gaps in targeting in response to the needs of vulnerable and conflict-affected people.</p>\n<p>This report provides an overview of the mix of resource flows to countries experiencing conflict and fragility, with an explicit focus on the flows that seek to address and respond to these issues. It should be noted, however, that while investments beyond aid are particularly important given their sheer scale, the availability and accessibility of data on international peace and security resource flows to fragile and conflict-affected countries beyond aid is weak.</p>\n<p>This report gives particular consideration to aid \u2013 also known as official development assistance (ODA). While small in volume compared with peace and security resource flows outside aid, it has an important role to play in fragile and conflict-affected contexts where domestic response capacities are weak, risks for private sector investment are high, and opportunities for mobilising wider sources of finance beyond aid are low. It is also often an important resource for supporting the transition from conflict to peace, alongside peacekeeping efforts. In addition, data is more easily accessible for ODA on conflict prevention and resolution, peace and security (CPS) than for peace and security resource flows outside of aid.</p>\n<p>Key findings emerging from the report include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Aggregate global military expenditure (US$1.7 trillion) is much greater than investments in peacekeeping (US$9.7 billion) and CPS ODA (US$3.2 billion) but our understanding of its role in developing countries is limited by poor data</strong>. Given the sheer scale of investments on peace and security beyond aid, it is important to understand the potential for such resources to address the needs of vulnerable and conflict-affected people in line with the delivery of the 2030 Agenda. However, data on military and security spending beyond aid is limited and it is not possible to provide a breakdown of international military and security resource flows to different developing countries. Better information on such resource flows is crucial. As the mandates of many peace and security actors are centred on defence and national security as opposed to development, it is particularly important to understand the share and aspects of such resources that may have the potential to address these needs. The inclusion of a wider set of peace and security activities as ODA, as set out in the <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/dac/DAC-HLM-Communique-2016.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">communiqu\u00e9</a> from the recent Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC) High-Level Meeting (February 2016) (such as activities to address violence extremism and strengthen civilian oversight of militaries), further emphasises the need for better data on these resource flows to ensure that the allocation of all ODA is transparent and accountable. Read our <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/new-aid-rules-allow-for-the-inclusion-of-a-wider-set-of-peace-and-security-activities\" target=\"_blank\">analysis of changes to aid rules regarding spending on peace and security</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>While growth in CPS ODA has outpaced the growth of all aid over the last decade, CPS ODA continues to comprise a very small proportion of total ODA (1.9% in 2014)</strong>. This raises questions about the need to strengthen such funding in line with the priority given to addressing peace and security in global development commitments, most notably the 2030 Agenda. This does not imply, however, that ODA should be reallocated to CPS from other sectors \u2212 it is important that all Global Goal targets are met. To achieve this with finite resources, it is critical that multiple sources of funding beyond aid are mobilised to deliver on all Global Goals. While aid plays a vital role in fragile and conflict-affected countries (where opportunities for domestic and private investments are lower than in other developing countries), it is just one of many resources that flow in. Other important resources include remittances as the largest flow (34% of all international resource flows to the 20 countries with the highest fragility scores in the 2014 Fund for Peace Fragile States Index) and foreign direct investment, among others.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Certain countries experiencing long-term fragility and conflict are prioritised for CPS ODA funding, while others are neglected. </strong>Countries with higher fragility scores on the Fund for Peace Fragile States Index tend to receive larger volumes of CPS ODA. Examples include Afghanistan, Syria, Somalia, Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan and Lebanon. In contrast, other countries such as Chad and the Central African Republic have higher fragility scores than Afghanistan (the largest recipient country of CPS ODA), yet both received smaller volumes of funding. The reasons for this are unclear and likely to reflect individual donor preferences. To leave no-one behind and ensure that the needs of vulnerable and conflict-affected people are met, donors\u2019 ODA-spending decisions must be based primarily on people\u2019s needs and risks.<strong><br/>\n</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>To ensure that available resources on peace and security are targeted effectively, better data on the needs of vulnerable and conflict-affected people at national and sub-national levels is vital</strong>. Greater investment in disaggregated and sub-national data is critical, including through efforts to strengthen domestic statistical capacity. However, recognising the real challenges involved in collecting and analysing data in complex conflict contexts, a differentiated approach should be taken in fragile and conflict-affected countries, appropriate to the specific stage of conflict and challenges experienced. To achieve this we need better evidence on what data collection methods work in these different contexts.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>A thorough review is needed to better understand the current alignment between existing financial reporting systems and the targets for Global Goal 16</strong>.

Italy reported by far the biggest difference between the preliminary and final figures (up by US$667 million). The United States (+US$367 million), Germany (+US$318 million) and France (+US$249 million) also reported significant increases. The largest reduction in reported ODA came from the United Kingdom (-US$81 million) although this represented only 0.4% of UK ODA.</p>\n<h3>Regional distribution of ODA in 2014</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Understanding-aid-spending-in-2014_regional-distribution.png\"><img alt=\"Understanding aid spending in 2014_regional distribution\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-10288 size-full\" height=\"450\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Understanding-aid-spending-in-2014_regional-distribution.png\" width=\"973\"/></a></p>\n<p>Despite the record levels of total ODA, disbursements to sub-Saharan Africa fell by over US$1.9 billion in real terms to US$44.0 billion. This is the lowest level in real terms since 2008, though is partly explained by lower levels of debt relief.</p>\n<p>The donors reporting the greatest reductions in ODA to sub-Saharan Africa were Japan<br/>\n(-US$677 million), the Global Fund (-US$584 million), African Development Bank (-US$352 million), IMF (-US$273 million) and Spain (-US$251 million). However the EU increased its disbursements to sub-Saharan by US$550 million and IDA increased its by US$231 million.</p>\n<p>The largest increase in ODA to a specific geographic region was Europe; this was driven by a substantial rise in ODA disbursements to Turkey (due to additional loans from France, Germany and the EU) and Ukraine (large budget support grants from the EU plus additional lending from Japan and Canada).</p>\n<p>There was also a very large rise (US$2.9 billion) in ODA without a specific geographical recipient. This totalled over US$32 billion, a rise of almost 10%. This was mainly driven by additional spending on refugees with both spending on refugees in donor countries and contributions to refugee-related special-purpose funds increasing significantly.</p>\n<h3>ODA to least developed countries in 2014</h3>\n<p>ODA to least developed countries (LDCs) declined noticeably, by US$4.2 billion to US$43.1 billion between 2013 and 2014. As a consequence, ODA to LDCs as a proportion of total ODA disbursements fell from 35% in 2013 to 31% in 2014 \u2013 the lowest share since 2006.</p>\n<p><strong>Figure 1: Net ODA to LDCs</strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Figure-1-Net-ODA-to-LDCs.jpg\"><img alt=\"Figure 1 Net ODA to LDCs\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10273\" height=\"308\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Figure-1-Net-ODA-to-LDCs.jpg\" width=\"484\"/></a></strong></p>\n<p>Japan reported the largest reduction (-US$3.7 billion), but this is mainly due to Japan\u2019s 2013 figure being boosted by debt relief to Myanmar. Of the other donors, ODA to LDCs from the Global Fund declined by US$517 million, France by US$460 million and the United States by US$346 million. The EU and Germany increased their disbursements to LDCs by US$616 million and US$441 million respectively.</p>\n<h3>Top recipients of ODA in 2014</h3>\n<p>Afghanistan continues to receive the most net ODA although ODA to Afghanistan has declined each year since its peak in 2011. Several sub-Saharan Africa countries who receive large amounts of ODA saw significant falls in 2014, notably Kenya and Tanzania.</p>\n<p>India saw a significant increase in ODA received for the second successive year after hitting a five-year low in 2012. ODA levels to Turkey also remain high, having been close to or over US$3 billion for four consecutive years.</p>\n<p>Pakistan received the largest increase in net ODA in dollar terms at almost US$1.5 billion or over 70%. Most of this rise was due to a large increase in IDA loans.</p>\n<h3>Composition of ODA in 2014</h3>\n<h4>ODA loans in 2014</h4>\n<p><strong>Figure 2: ODA loan disbursements (gross)</strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Figure-2-ODA-loan-disbursements-gross.jpg\"><img alt=\"Figure 2 ODA loan disbursements (gross)\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10274\" height=\"271\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Figure-2-ODA-loan-disbursements-gross.jpg\" width=\"446\"/></a></strong></p>\n<p>Once again the vast majority of bilateral loans from DAC donors (over 90% of new gross lending) came from just three donors: Japan, Germany and France.</p>\n<p>While Japan\u2019s loans declined from their 2013 peak (Japan\u2019s lending in 2013 was boosted by a one-off debt reorganisation deal with Myanmar), Germany and France increased lending significantly, by 64% and 22% respectively. Japan has been a major provider of ODA loans for many years and disbursing 59% of its gross ODA as loans in 2014 is not exceptional. In fact, lending has accounted for at least 50% of Japan\u2019s ODA in five of the past six years.</p>\n<p>In contrast France and Germany have, in recent years, massively increased the proportion of their ODA provided in the form of loans. In 2005, 10% of French and just 8% of German gross ODA was in the form of loans \u2013 by 2014 this had grown to 45% and 35% respectively. Loans from Japan are typically more concessional that those from France or Germany, with Japanese loans in 2014 having an average 78% grant element, compared with 53% for France and 44% for Germany.</p>\n<p><strong>Figure 3: Main bilateral providers of ODA loans</strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Figure-3-Main-bilateral-providers-of-ODA-loans.jpg\"><img alt=\"Figure 3 Main bilateral providers of ODA loans\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10275\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Figure-3-Main-bilateral-providers-of-ODA-loans.jpg\" width=\"543\"/></a></strong></p>\n<h4>Debt relief in 2014</h4>\n<p>Debt relief declined sharply in 2014 with debt relief grants from DAC donors and multilateral agencies totalling US$1.3 billion. This contrasts with US$6.1 billion in debt relief grants recorded in both 2012 and 2013 and means that levels of debt relief hit a 25-year low in 2014.</p>\n<p><strong>Figure 4: Debt grant relief</strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Figure-4-Debt-grant-relief.jpg\"><img alt=\"Figure 4 Debt grant relief\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10276\" height=\"290\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Figure-4-Debt-grant-relief.jpg\" width=\"475\"/></a></strong></p>\n<h4>The aid bundle in 2014</h4>\n<p>The overall composition of the aid bundle changed little in 2014. The level of non-transfer aid fell from 20% of gross ODA in 2013 to 17% in 2014. This was due to the fall in debt relief, which was only partially offset by donors\u2019 increase in refugee costs in donor countries.</p>\n<p><strong>Figure 5: Aid bundles</strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/DAC-donor-average.jpg\"><img alt=\"DAC donor average\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-10277 \" height=\"157\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/DAC-donor-average.jpg\" width=\"566\"/></a></strong></p>\n<p>The aid bundles of the five DAC donors providing the most ODA:</p>\n<p><strong>France</strong> continued to report the largest proportion of non-transfer aid \u2013 although this fell from 38% in 2013 to 26% in 2014.

This has impacted significantly on economic growth prospects for the poorest countries that rely on exporting these commodities, and is a trend predicted to continue for years to come. Combined with this, government revenue from these resources has declined significantly in almost all of these countries. The IMF also found that the benefits of price falls have not been fully realised in the developing countries that are importers of these goods, constraining potential growth there also.</p>\n<p>This reduced economic growth and government income has the potential to undermine progress in poverty alleviation in the poorest countries in the world.

The R&amp;E system tends to operate independently of host governments and local actors at all levels and is driven by donors.</p>\n<p>The use of evidence by decision-makers in the East Africa region is also significantly impeded by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the limited extent to which national and local policy makers and practitioners value and can engage with R&amp;E outputs and are willing and able to act on their findings</li>\n<li>limited linkages between research and policy and practice communities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A common and shared research agenda for humanitarian R&amp;E in the region seems to be lacking and there is little shared analysis of data/evidence collected over the long term on cyclical causes and responses to repeated humanitarian crises. This therefore limits the potential for a strategic and future-focused body of R&amp;E work.</p>\n<p>To improve this R&amp;E landscape, a locally owned, more strategically coherent research agenda that is broader than the current focus on resilience and which links vulnerability to issues such as energy, water, transport infrastructure, digital communications, climate change adaptation and human security is needed.\u00a0This will more likely gain the attention of governments and prove useful in the longer-term for tackling humanitarian crises.</p>\n<h3><strong>Main recommendations from the study</strong></h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Build host government ownership of R&amp;E through existing co-ordination mechanisms with government.</li>\n<li>Put in place systems to improve the quality of research by\u00a0developing basic, voluntary protocol for the conduct and management of humanitarian R&amp;E drawing on ethical social science research principles.</li>\n<li>Incentivise local content in research activities by ensuring local researchers are included in carrying out research especially at the design and analysis phase.</li>\n<li>Improve research uptake and strengthen R&amp;E culture through innovative ways of dissemination such as knowledge exchanges, online sessions, social media, radio.</li>\n<li>Research projects should also indicate how uptake will be promoted to demonstrate the link between producers and consumers of evidence.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can download the <a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Humanitarian-evidence-systems-mapping-in-East-Africa_Feb2016.pdf\">full report</a> or the <a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Humanitarian-evidence-systems-mapping-Executive-Summary.pdf\">executive summary only</a>.</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Food insecurity, Ethiopia", "authors": [], "format": "Crisis briefing", "date": "06 Jan 2016", "description": "On 5 January 2016 we responded to a funding alert for food insecurity in Ethiopia.

Successful partnerships between the public and private sectors for effective development are diverse, organic and often context specific. There are common components of success that can be identified from experience, and lessons that can be learnt from different contexts, to ensure that future partnerships are designed to achieve positive social and economic outcomes for poor people.</p>\n<p>This report reviews recent evidence, focusing on a sample of case study examples from a range of regions and countries, and aims to contribute to broader discussions on the role of the private sector in development. It concludes by identifying some areas where the Global Partnership for Effective Development Co-operation (GPEDC) could play a useful role in both: (a) recognising and sharing the significant progress on partnerships already being achieved in some countries and sectors; and (b) guiding and motivating other countries and sectors to improve their performance.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Private-sector-in-development-effectiveness_FULL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Download the full paper</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Private-sector-in-development-effectiveness_EXEC-SUMMARY.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Download the Executive Summary</a></p>\n<h3>Access the other two reports here:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/the-gpedcs-contribution-to-the-2030-agenda-for-sustainable-development\" target=\"_blank\">The Global Partnership for Effective Development Co-operation\u2019s Contribution to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/progress-in-delivering-the-busan-partnership-for-effective-development-co-operation-in-states-of-fragility\" target=\"_blank\">Progress in delivering the Busan Partnership for Effective Development Co-operation in states of fragility</a></p>\n<p>Photo credit: GAVI Alliance</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Progress in delivering the Busan Partnership for Effective Development Co-operation in states of fragility", "authors": ["Sarah Dalrymple"], "format": "Report", "date": "09 Dec 2015", "description": "In November 2015 we developed three reports for the 2nd Busan Global Partnership Forum in consultation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/progress-in-delivering-the-busan-partnership-for-effective-development-co-operation-in-states-of-fragility/", "body": "<div class=\"post__img p-t--1 p-b--1\">\n<div class=\"m-b--1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-full size-full wp-post-image\" height=\"1365\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/00038_Rufugee-Jordan_2048x1365.jpg\" srcset=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/00038_Rufugee-Jordan_2048x1365.jpg 2048w, http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/00038_Rufugee-Jordan_2048x1365-320x212.jpg 320w, http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/00038_Rufugee-Jordan_2048x1365-555x370.jpg 555w\" width=\"2048\"/></div>\n<div><p class=\"small\"></p></div>\n</div><div class=\"lead\"><p>Evidence on the delivery of development cooperation in fragile states</p>\n</div><div class=\"p-t--1 p-b--1 m-b--1\" style=\"border-top:2px solid #f2f2f2; border-bottom:2px solid #f2f2f2;\">\n<div style=\"overflow:hidden;\">\n<div class=\"col-md-7\">\n<div><a class=\"btn btn--dark pdf-download\" ga-event-action=\"pdf-download\" ga-event-category=\"Download\" ga-event-label=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Delivering-Busan-Partnership-Agreement-in-fragile-states_FULL.pdf\" ga-on=\"click\" href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Delivering-Busan-Partnership-Agreement-in-fragile-states_FULL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Delivering Busan Partnership Agreement in fragile states\">\n<i class=\"p ss-pdf\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0 Delivering Busan Partnership Agreement in fragile states\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"p ss-download\"></i>\n</a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div> Modal <div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"modal pdf-popup\">\n<div class=\"modal-dialog wide\">\n<div class=\"modal-body \">\n<div>\n<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"btn-close\" href=\"#\" id=\"close-pdf-modal\">\u00d7</a>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t          Can we contact you later to ask your opinion about the publication you just downloaded?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf yes, please leave your email below.

Fostering political cross-government and buy-in and driving inclusive political dialogue is also critical.</li>\n<li>Whilst the use of country systems in fragile states has increased overall, limited progress has been made in strengthening the quality of public finance management (PFM) systems. As donors avert risks associated with using weak or non-existent systems, parallel systems are often created. Greater focus on strengthening the capacity and quality of PFM systems is necessary for risk management.</li>\n<li>Support should not be limited to states that already have government institutions and accountability systems in place; establishing financing mechanisms to reimburse government salary payments, for example, is critical to the very formation of government institutions.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>A differentiated approach should be taken in fragile states, which respond differently depending on the specific context and type of fragility.

Our second <a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Investments-to-End-Poverty-Report-2015_online.pdf\"><em>Investments to End Poverty report</em></a> and our online <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/data\"><em>Development Data Hub</em></a> show that when data is disaggregated, people are being left behind. Where poverty appears to be reducing in some countries, many people are being lost along the way. Many of the world\u2019s poorest countries need a significant change in trajectory if they are to see an end to poverty.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Investments-to-End-Poverty-Report-2015_online.pdf\"><em>Investments to End Poverty 2015</em> </a>looks at the challenge of getting poverty to zero, the mix of resources available for tackling poverty, and how the data needs to improve to be fit for the purpose of ending extreme poverty by 2030.</p>\n<p>The report focuses on analysing and quantifying the extent of the challenge to make sure no one is left behind, and it looks at the role of domestic and international resources including the comparative advantage of official development assistance (ODA). The report investigates the quality of the data, bringing in new research on civil registration data in Africa and the potential of initiatives such as the International Aid Transparency Initiative. The report shows that we need to be ambitious and committed to improving data to ensure we are equipped for getting poverty to zero.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Overview.pdf\">Read the report summary</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Investments-to-End-Poverty-Report-2015_online.pdf\">Read the full report</a></p>\n<h3>Key findings:</h3>\n<h4>Ending poverty will be more challenging than halving it has been \u2013 people are still being left behind.</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>In 30 countries, the number of people living in extreme poverty increased between 2002 and 2011</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The 18 countries showing the most rapid increase in poverty in the last decade are all in sub-Saharan Africa</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>To end poverty by 2030, sub-Saharan Africa would need to reduce poverty at a pace faster than South Asia has achieved over the last 15 years</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The proportion of people living in extreme poverty in fragile states has risen from around 20% in 1990 to 62% in 2015</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>National trends in poverty reduction mask big differences within countries. Between 2005 and 2012 India saw 10 states reduce poverty by 10% a year while in 8 smaller states poverty actually rose.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>The resources that could drive poverty eradication should be targeted at the poorest people, wherever they are.</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Governments in many developing countries raise too little revenue to implement the SDGs at the national level</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>In 24 of the 33 countries where depth of poverty is highest globally, government revenues are less than PPP$1.37 per person per day compared with PPP$34 per person per day in high income countries. (PPP = adjusted for purchasing power parity)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Low government revenues mean that, although sub-Saharan Africa spends the second highest proportion of revenues on health among all regions, spending per person is the second lowest of any region</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Where poverty is deepest, revenue is projected to have the slowest growth</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The comparative advantage of aid is that it can be targeted more directly at reducing poverty than other resources</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>There is significant room to improve the targeting of aid. 29% of ODA goes to countries with a depth of poverty of less than 1%, and in 2013 only 9% of ODA commitments to build resilience against environmental shocks went to the most environmentally vulnerable countries.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>We need much better data on poverty and resources because the data is not fit for purpose to get poverty to zero.</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Our understanding of global poverty is not based on direct knowledge of people in poverty but is from surveys layered with assumptions to derive estimates about level, depth and distribution of poverty</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Systems to produce even basic information on how many people there are do not function in many African countries</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Just 12 of 55 African countries have comprehensive birth registration and a quarter of African countries have not done a survey since 2008 or earlier.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Downloads</h3>\n<p>Full report\u00a0\u2013 <a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Investments-to-End-Poverty-Report-2015_online.pdf\">PDF</a></p>\n<p>Overview \u2013 <a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Overview.pdf\">PDF</a>\u00a0<a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Overview.xlsx\">Data</a></p>\n<p>Chapter 1: Ending extreme poverty by 2030 \u2013 <a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Chapter-1-Ending-extreme-poverty-by-2030.pdf\">PDF</a>\u00a0<a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Chapter-1_Ending-extreme-poverty-by-2030.xlsx\">Data</a></p>\n<p>Chapter 2: The mix of all resources \u2013 <a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Chapter-2-The-mix-of-all-resources.pdf\">PDF</a>\u00a0<a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Chapter-2_The-mix-of-all-resources-11-15.xlsx\">Data</a></p>\n<p>Chapter 3: Domestic public resources \u2013 <a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Chapter-3-Domestic-public-resources.pdf\">PDF</a>\u00a0<a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Chapter-3_Domestic-public-resources.xlsx\">Data</a></p>\n<p>Chapter 4: International official finance \u2013 <a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Chapter-4-International-official-finance.pdf\">PDF</a>\u00a0<a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Chapter-4_International-official-finance.xlsx\">Data</a></p>\n<p>Chapter 5: Data for decision making \u2013 <a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Chapter-5-Data-for-decision-making.pdf\">PDF</a>\u00a0<a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Chapter-5_Data.for_.decision-making.xlsx\">Data</a></p>\n<p>Notes\u00a0\u2013 <a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Notes.pdf\">PDF</a></p>\n<p>Annex \u2013 <a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Investments-to-End-Poverty-2015-Annex.pdf\">PDF</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/development_initiatives/sets/72157659008011962\">Download key graphics from the report</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Displacement in Colombia", "authors": [], "format": "Crisis briefing", "date": "18 Sep 2015", "description": "On 16 September 2015 we responded to a funding alert in response to displacement in the departments of Norte de Santander, Arauca, La Guajira and Vichada i", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/displacement-in-colombia/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"p-t--1 p-b--1 m-b--1\" style=\"border-top:2px solid #f2f2f2;

To improve the accounting methods used for deciding what should be counted as concessional loans, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)\u2019s Development Assistance Committee (DAC) has agreed to overhaul the method for calculating how much of a donors\u2019 lending should be counted as ODA. When they come fully into force, these rules will mark the biggest change in the way ODA is measured since the concept was introduced in the 1960s.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Timeline-ODA-1.png\"><img alt=\"Timeline ODA 1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9353\" height=\"294\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Timeline-ODA-1.png\" width=\"731\"/></a><br/>\nThe amount of ODA provided in the form of loans has been on the increase since the middle of the last decade. This report examines these trends over the period 2005 to 2013, highlighting the main providers and recipients of loans and showing how the balance has changed between loans and grants for these countries.\u00a0 It also looks at the most recent data on ODA loans alongside measures of debt sustainability, in order to address the question of whether ODA loans are being given to countries that can afford to repay them. The new rules on accounting for ODA loans are examined in detail, the changes explained and an assessment made of what the impact on ODA levels might be.</p>\n<p>This <a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/ODA-loans-tracking-a-growing-source-of-development-financing.pdf\">report</a> summarises some important implications and considerations for policy-makers and stakeholders.</p>\n<p><strong>View our summary presentation of key trends, findings and implications explained by the report author Rob Tew. This was originally presented as a free webinar </strong><strong>\u2018<a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/understanding-oda-loans-a-growing-source-of-development-financing\">Understanding ODA Loans</a>\u2019 on 24 June 2015.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/l96lQeNC4s0?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\n<h3>Key findings</h3>\n<h4>Trends in loan giving</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>In aggregate, ODA loans have risen faster than grants and now account for over a quarter of total ODA disbursements to developing countries. Gross ODA lending from DAC donors increased by 73%, whereas ODA grants from DAC donors (excluding debt relief) grew at a much slower pace, rising by just 25%.</li>\n<li>Growth in ODA loans has been driven by a small group of donors. For some of these, the growth in ODA loan giving has far outstripped increases in ODA grant giving. For example, France more than trebled its lending, while French grants fell in real terms.</li>\n<li>The increase in ODA loans seems to be more pronounced in countries receiving higher overall levels of ODA. Some ODA recipients have seen loans increase at a much greater pace than grants, including a number of low-income countries. Four countries \u2013 Egypt, Kenya, Myanmar and Turkey \u2013 saw an increase in ODA loans of over 500%.</li>\n<li>The most recent data shows that donors typically give ODA in the form of loans to developing countries who are not overburdened with debt. However, overall levels of indebtedness and the cost of servicing that debt looks likely to increase for many developing countries over the next few years.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Impact of the new DAC rules</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Under the new rules, only the grant element of a loan will be reported as ODA rather than the full face value. Also, loan repayments will no longer be subtracted from the headline ODA figure. These new rules certainly give a fairer measure of ODA in the sense that highly concessional loans will count for more ODA than loans at lower levels of concessionality. For loans disbursed under the new rules, it is sensible to discontinue the practice of subtracting loan repayments from the headline ODA figure as only the grant element of the original loan will have been reported in the first place.</li>\n<li>Loans disbursed under the old rules will also no longer have their repayments subtracted from the headline ODA figure. This has a distorting effect, meaning that, for some countries, the reported levels of ODA will appear significantly higher than under the old rules. For example, Japan\u2019s reported 2013 ODA appears over 50% higher when the new rules are applied.</li>\n<li>Another effect of no longer subtracting loan repayments from headline ODA is that, in the long run, development assistance given in the form of loans will generate a higher level of reported ODA than was the case under the old rules. This may incentivise donors to give more aid in the form of loans to maximise their reported levels of ODA.</li>\n<li>The new rules allow donors to report a higher level of ODA for a loan to a low income country than for the same loan to a middle income country; this could create an incentive for donors to give more loans to the poorest countries.</li>\n<li>Some important elements of the new rules, especially in the area of debt relief, have yet to be agreed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Recommendations</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>It is vitally important that donors pay close attention to debt sustainability when making lending decisions in the future. This is especially true in light of the increasing debt burden likely to be faced by many developing countries and the potential for the new ODA loan rules to incentivise lending to low income and least developed countries.</li>\n<li>The OECD should look again at the decision to no longer subtract loan repayments on old ODA loans from the headline ODA figure under the new measure. This decision will have a distorting effect on the ODA totals for years to come.</li>\n<li>Reforms to the measurement of ODA loans should be accompanied by similar reforms in the measurement of the value of debt relief in the ODA statistics. In the past the measurement debt relief has significantly overstated the amount of ODA disbursed by donors.</li>\n<li>The proposed cash flow measure of ODA which will be reported alongside the new headline statistics should include loan interest repayments in its cash flow considerations and not just loan capital repayments as in the present measure of \u2018net ODA\u2019.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Global Humanitarian Assistance Report 2015", "authors": [], "format": "Report", "date": "18 Jun 2015", "description": "Thank you to all those that participated in our event in London and online.

An extraordinary combination of crises continues to test international, national and local capacity to prevent, prepare and respond as needs continue to outstrip available resources. Global processes taking place during 2015 and 2016 \u2013 including the Financing for Development process and the World Humanitarian Summit \u2013 offer important opportunities to shape global strategies and address needs across development and humanitarian spheres for years to come.</p>\n<p>The Global Humanitarian Assistance (GHA) report 2015 shows that poverty and vulnerability to crises are intrinsically linked and that international humanitarian assistance continues to go predominantly to long-term recipients. This emphasises the need to build resilience, address the underlying causes of crisis and meet the long-term needs of people affected by crisis. For this to happen, a shared responsibility between humanitarian, development, climate change and other actors is critical as is the mobilisation of other resources beyond humanitarian assistance.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/GHAreport2015/\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"GHA\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6442\" height=\"768\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/GHA.jpg\" width=\"1366\"/></a></p>\n<h3>Key findings of the report include:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>International humanitarian assistance rose for a second year running to a record US$24.5\u00a0billion in 2014. All of 2013\u2019s largest donors gave more in 2014, and many gave their largest amounts. Despite this rise, funding was not sufficient to meet needs. In response to the scale of need in 2014, UN-coordinated humanitarian appeals requested the highest amount of funding to date \u2013 a total of US$19.5 billion \u2013 yet a record US$7.5 billion of requirements went unmet.</li>\n<li>2013 saw a shift in the geography of displacement \u2013 with more people displaced now in the Middle East than in Africa. As a result, Gulf donors rose in prominence, and Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) became the 6th and 15th largest government donors, respectively.</li>\n<li>Two thirds (66%) of international humanitarian assistance continues to go to long-term recipients such as Syria, Somalia and Pakistan, as crises are protracted or disasters recur in the same places year on year.</li>\n<li>An estimated 93% of people living in extreme poverty (defined as less than US$1.25 a day) are in countries that are either fragile or environmentally vulnerable or both, emphasising the need to address the underlying causes of crises.</li>\n<li>Domestic response and capacities often play an important role in best meeting needs and reducing the need for international finance, as case studies of Turkey and Mexico show.</li>\n<li>Of total international humanitarian assistance, only 0.2% went directly to local and national NGOs and 3.1% to the governments of affected states.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The report uses unique methodologies to gather and analyse data to provide the most up-to-date and comprehensive picture of global humanitarian financing. It includes in-depth analysis of international financing to national and local actors, as well as wider resource flows to the most crisis-affected, fragile and environmentally vulnerable countries.</p>\n<p>We have produced this report annually since 2000, to present a shared and independent evidence base for anyone engaged in providing, using, receiving and understanding assistance in crisis settings. In a year when financing for crisis preparedness and response is under scrutiny as never before, our report provides the data to inform discussion, which we hope will deliver change.</p>\n<p>All of the data contained within this report is available to download. We are always pleased to hear from you, so do share with us your feedback and ideas for how we can get better data or make it more useful.

This UK-hosted summit focussed on transforming political commitments into practical action. It was built on the foundations of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/274724/A_DECLARATION_OF_COMMITMENT_TO_END_SEXUAL_VIOLENCE_IN_CONFLICT.pdf\">Declaration of Commitment to End Sexual Violence in Conflict</a> , launched by the UK government in September 2013, and the November 2013 Call to Action on Protecting Girls and Women in Emergencies\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/256872/Final_Communique_v_11_Nov_4.pdf\">Communiqu\u00e9</a>. To date, 140 governments have endorsed the declaration and 32 governments are signatory to the Communiqu\u00e9.</p>\n<p>The global summit, declaration and Communiqu\u00e9 all led to agreements to strengthen funding to respond to sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV). The global summit recommended: \u201c<em>Donors need to make longer-term funding commitments (beyond one year) in order to build necessary systems and long-term engagement with communities; funds should be made accessible for local level organisations and leveraged from other areas.\u201d </em>[i]</p>\n<p>Funding pledges totalling <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/j/prm/policyissues/issues/c62379.htm\">over $US41 million</a> were made publically by donors as a result of the Communiqu\u00e9 \u00a0and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/390742/PSVI_post_summit_report_Online2.pdf\">over US$15 million</a> as an outcome of the global summit.</p>\n<h3>Have these global agreements increased funding for action on SGBV?</h3>\n<p>Funding to address SGBV remains low though has increased between 2012 and 2014</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_9009\" style=\"width: 660px\"><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/123.jpg\"><img alt=\"Figure 1: Total humanitarian funding for action on SGBV, 2011\u20132014\" class=\" wp-image-9009\" height=\"311\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/123.jpg\" width=\"650\"/></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Figure 1: Total humanitarian funding for action on SGBV, 2011\u20132014</p></div>\n<p><em>Source: Development Initiatives based on UN OCHA FTS data</em></p>\n<p>Note: Funding analysis captures SGBV-related projects reported to UN OCHA\u2019s FTS. As there is currently no identifier or marker specifically for SGBV in the FTS, a keyword search was undertaken on project titles and descriptions. Thus, the analysis may not capture all SGBV-related funding, particularly where activities are mainstreamed across all other programmes, and/or where funding falls outside of humanitarian spending (ie what is reported to the FTS).</p>\n<p>Figure 1 shows that humanitarian assistance for action on SGBV doubled from US$50 million in 2012 to US$107 million in 2014. The increase in funding during this period mirrors the growth of political attention to, and policy commitments related to, SGBV from 2013, culminating in the global summit in 2014.</p>\n<p>Funding to SGBV increased from US$93 million in 2013 to US$107 million in 2014, illustrating an increase of US$14 million during the year from the signing of the Communiqu\u00e9 in 2013. This is less than a third of the total pledged by donors following the Communiqu\u00e9 (over US$41 million).</p>\n<p>Despite the rise in funding to address SGBV overall, it continues to be low, and only constituted 0.6% of total humanitarian assistance reported to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affair (OCHA)\u2019s Financial Tracking Service (FTS) in 2013, decreasing slightly to 0.5% in 2014.</p>\n<p>Levels of funding to address SGBV may, however, be higher than these reported figures. This may be because SGBV activities that are mainstreamed within other programmes are not captured in this analysis. This analysis has largely only captured projects that include an explicit reference to SGBV (or related terms) in the project description as it is not possible to capture mainstreamed spending on SGBV using current reporting mechanisms. Also, additional SGBV activities may be funded through non-humanitarian activities (i.e. development or stabilisation activities) that are not captured in the FTS and are beyond the focus of this analysis.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, just under half of SGBV funding (49%) identified in this analysis was not coded using the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) gender marker in 2014 (but captured through Global Humanitarian Assistance coding). Poor reporting on gender using the IASC gender marker is a challenge across humanitarian funding more broadly. In 2014, less than a third (62%) of all humanitarian funding reported to UN OCHA\u2019s FTS was not coded using the gender marker. As a result, it is difficult to track the delivery of policy commitments on gender and SGBV.</p>\n<h3>South Sudan was the largest recipient of SGBV-related funding in 2014</h3>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_9010\" style=\"width: 661px\"><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/gender-briefing-fig-2.jpg\"><img alt=\"Figure 2: Top ten recipients of SGBV funding, 2013\u20132014\" class=\" wp-image-9010\" height=\"334\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/gender-briefing-fig-2.jpg\" width=\"651\"/></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Figure 2: Top ten recipients of SGBV funding, 2013\u20132014</p></div>\n<p><em>Source: Development Initiatives based on UN OCHA FTS</em></p>\n<p>Based on the available data, South Sudan was the largest recipient of humanitarian assistance for SGBV-related projects, receiving US$21.2 million in 2014, almost three times as much as the next largest recipient Iraq (US$7.2 million). It overtook funding received by the largest recipients in 2013, Syria and Somalia (US$19.1 million and US$12.6 million respectively). Yemen received US$6.7 million and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), often the focus of global SGBV attention, US$5.4 million (an increase of 22% from 2013).</p>\n<h3>The way forward</h3>\n<p>To ensure the momentum built from last year\u2019s Call to Action and Global Summit is not lost, it is critical that donors meet the funding pledges made and continue to channel funding towards the goal of addressing SGBV against women, girls, boys and men in emergencies. This would also align with the proposed post-2015 sustainable development goals\u2019 stand-alone goal on gender equality.</p>\n<p>Better reporting is also needed so the levels of funding can be properly understood and tracked. Two improvements would facilitate this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Better reporting using the IASC marker. </strong>As noted in our briefing note on \u2018<a href=\"http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/report/funding-gender-emergencies-trends\">Funding gender in emergencies</a>\u2019, a mandatory commitment from all donors to use this marker when reporting on humanitarian spending to the UNOCHA\u2019s\u00a0FTS \u2013 for UN appeals and more widely \u2013 would help to better track overall funding for gender equality and so help to identify SGBV funding within this.</li>\n<li><strong>Adopting a code for reporting on funding that is specifically targeted at addressing SGBV </strong>within the existing IASC gender marker and/or within the FTS.

To hold educational authorities to account for how they are using public resources to deliver education services, Wolde needs accurate, up-to-date and disaggregated data about school performance. When he was unable to obtain this information from government sources, Wolde devised an alternative way to source the data \u2013 by supporting citizens to generate the data themselves.</p>\n<p>In partnership with the Ministry of Education, Wolde runs the School Report Card project. Parents use the School Report Card to log details about school performance, such as children\u2019s access to textbooks, school facilities, parental responsibility, teacher attendance and pupil discipline. By creating a comprehensive collection of citizen-generated data, there is now substantial information about the quality of education across the country.</p>\n<h4>Examples of Wolde\u2019s Data Use</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Using citizen-generated data to improve school performance: </strong>The School Report Card is designed to be an easily accessible tool for parents to demand improved performance from teachers, head teachers and the School Board of Management. Wolde sends the assessment scores of key factors, such as toilet numbers, pupil attendance and teacher absenteeism, to key stakeholders in the education system so that officials at a district and county level can take appropriate action towards schools that perform poorly.</li>\n<li><strong>Using citizen-generated data to guide education spending: </strong>Wolde uses the information from the School Report Card to identify where money is not being spent resourcefully, how educational resources are being spent by individual schools, and where educational authorities can target their finances to improve the quality of education in Kenya. This information is publicly shared via radio and <a href=\"http://www.nta.or.ke/in-media/videos/329-nta-launches-school-report-card-2013\">television</a>, which puts pressure on head teachers \u2013 who control school budgets \u2013 to spend money more efficiently.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Challenges to Wolde having better information</h4>\n<p>In the past, the NTA has tried to find information about schools from central government sources. However, they found that the <strong>government</strong> <strong>data was out of date </strong>on the Kenya Open Data Platform \u2013 the most recent information about primary schools was from 2008/09. They also approached contacts at the Ministry of Education but they were unable to provide the depth of detail needed for NTA to assess school performance.</p>\n<p>The data that comes in from the School Report Cards is extensive and in hard copy format. This means that it <strong>needs to be transferred to Excel</strong> before any analysis on the data can be done. This process is time consuming for Wolde and his team, and leaves the data open to input error that potentially decreases its value. Some head teachers perceive this as being a \u2018snooping\u2019 exercise on their activities and spending, rather than seeing this as a programme for transparency and accountability. This can lead to <strong>resistance</strong> and a lack of cooperation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/CASE-STUDY-Using-citizen-data-to-improve-schools-Kenya-SHORT-2015-05.pdf\">Download this summary as a pdf</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/CASE-STUDY-Using-citizen-data-to-improve-schools-Kenya-LONG-2015-05.pdf\">Download Wolde Wesa\u2019s full story</a></p>\n<h4>Other case studies in this series:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/using-budget-data-to-improve-water-policy-in-nepal-2\" target=\"_blank\">Using budget data to improve water policy in Nepal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/using-foreign-aid-data-to-improve-policy-making-2\" target=\"_blank\">Using foreign aid data to improve policy making</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/opening-public-data-to-improve-government-transparency-in-nepal\" target=\"_blank\">Opening public data to improve government transparency in Nepal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/using-information-about-local-development-projects-to-empower-citizens\">Using information about local development projects to empower citizens in Nepal</a></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/transforming-data-into-useful-information-the-story-of-a-liberian-transparency-advocate\">Transforming data into useful information for transparency advocacy in Liberia</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/using-project-data-to-improve-sexual-health-services-in-kenya\" target=\"_blank\">Using project data to improve sexual health services in Kenya</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/using-public-finance-data-to-monitor-sub-national-resource-allocation-in-kenya\" target=\"_blank\">Using public finance data to monitor sub-national resource allocation in Kenya</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Using project data to improve sexual health services in Kenya", "authors": [], "format": "Case study", "date": "26 May 2015", "description": "This profile is part of a series looking at how data is being accessed and used in developing countries.

More specifically, Kubai monitors MSK\u2019s programmes so that lessons can be fed into the planning of new projects and advocacy work. He uses data from the clinics to evaluate the impact MSK has on key health indicators within Kenya, and also to provide evidence that greater attention is needed from government and donors on reproductive services. He also uses wider health service information to identify which resources are going where in order to better direct, prioritise and design MSK\u2019s work.</p>\n<h4>Examples of Kubai\u2019s data use</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Using data to strategically shape programmes to help those most in need: </strong>Kubai and the team at MSK use data to carry out situation analyses in many geographical areas, which determine the demographics and public services available. This information is used to identify communities that are not currently receiving services so that MSK can target their services to meet their needs.</li>\n<li><strong>Using data to ensure resources are used effectively: </strong>Kubai collects data about the services offered by other healthcare providers in order to prevent a concentration of services in one area and a duplication of efforts. This means that MSK\u2019s resources can be used more efficiently, and it also means that they can remain competitive and provide a valuable service to those who need it.</li>\n<li><strong>Using data to advocate for better reproductive healthcare:</strong> MSK uses anonymised health data collected at clinics to write reports about the problems arising from lack of reproductive healthcare, both for individuals and communities. These have been used by the government, and as a result the Ministry of Health has supported MSK in strengthening Amua family planning clinics. The Amua clinics make reproductive healthcare affordable in communities where the service is needed most. Health information is also given to citizens through radio shows, explaining the importance of contraception and dispelling concerns raised by patients at the clinics.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Challenges to Kubai having better information</h4>\n<p>Often <strong>important information from other healthcare providers is not made publically available</strong>. This makes it harder for Kubai to understand where the unmet need for reproductive healthcare is, and prevents him from learning from the experiences of peers. If the health data collected by other healthcare providers was open, it would allow Kubai to more efficiently target MSK\u2019s projects to ensure sufficient healthcare is available to all those in need of it.</p>\n<p>Kubai carries out most of his analysis using MS Excel, however for more complex statistical analysis the SPSS software package needs to be used. Currently much of the MSK\u2019s SPSS data analysis work is conducted by specialised data analysts based in Marie Stopes International\u2019s (MSI) office in London, which leads to a delay in seeing the results and a reliance on those outside of the country. <strong>More training in basic data analysis</strong> across the staff within MSK would enable all areas of work, from project planning to service delivery, and from advocacy to strategy development, to be more informed and evidence based.</p>\n<p>Kubai often has <strong>difficulty in gaining access to the information </strong>he needs in a timely manner, because bureaucracy \u2013 often within the government \u2013 slows the process down. Furthermore, the information he gains access to is often <strong>incomplete.</strong> For example on a government website listing the clinics in Kenya, many were missing and others that had closed were still listed.

He conducts analysis on public finance in Kenya, using the information to support civil society organisations (CSOs), journalists and citizens to participate in budget processes at both a national and county level.</p>\n</div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p><em>This profile is part of a series looking at how data is being accessed and used in developing countries.</em></p>\n<h4>John\u2019s demand for data and information</h4>\n<blockquote><p><strong>\u201cBig decisions about resource allocation should be based on sound evidence\u201d</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>The recent devolution of administrative governance in Kenya has lead to major changes in the way the government plans and spends its money. There is now a dual system involving two levels of government with independent but related budgets. John and his colleagues at IBP work to support Kenyan non-state actors to understand the new system, interpret national and county budgets, and use the information to engage with budgetary processes so that the government\u2019s allocation of resources to counties is based on sound evidence and meets the needs of citizens. To do this effectively John needs to find, access, use and share a wide range of public data, including data on sub-national spending and the level of need (demographics, poverty, health and education). John needs to present accurate, objective evidence in his research work. This is so that citizens, the independent Commission on Revenue Allocation and administrative staff at county level can use it to make informed resource-allocation decisions based on capacity and needs.</p>\n<h4>Examples of John\u2019s data use</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Using budget data to audit national transparency:</strong> John and his colleagues at IBP monitor the Kenyan government\u2019s disclosure and publication of budget information, and they publish their findings through the <a href=\"http://www.obstracker.org/\">open budget tracker</a>. This is one of the most comprehensive measures of budget transparency at the central government level. Kenyan journalists and civil society have been trained to use the <strong>tracker</strong> as a tool for budget advocacy.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Using data to promote better sub-national resource allocation</strong>: John and his colleagues\u2019 experience of working with poverty and budget data has enabled them to identify changes in the way revenue is shared between Kenya\u2019s 47 counties. They recently submitted a memorandum to Kenya\u2019s independent Commission on Revenue Allocation, recommending that the revenue-sharing formula is shifted towards a focus on need, capacity and effort. As well as engaging with government, IBP has made a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L-SRYKWTmA\">video</a> about revenue sharing to generate interest by non-state actors.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Challenges to John having better information</h4>\n<blockquote><p><strong>\u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be a process for systematically putting public data out there. I have to go and find what I need.\u201d</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Some of the data that John needs are available from online sources such the Kenya Open Data Initiative portal (KODI) or government ministry websites, but John has found that <strong>a significant portion of data from government ministries is stored off-online</strong>. John often has to <strong>rely on relationships</strong> he has built up over the years with officials to gain access to offline information. Some data is only available in hard copies, which means John has to transcribe it, and sometimes, as with the annual Kenya National Bureau of Statistics Economic Survey, he has to pay for it too. Even though KODI has a good cache of data, John finds most of the data are <strong>out of</strong> <strong>date. </strong>John would like to see KODI\u2019s capacity increased to enable them to regularly update their datasets and to encourage more government ministries and organisations to share their datasets online.</p>\n<p>John has recently faced challenges sourcing core datasets to support his work on devolution. He was not able to locate a reliable public dataset on historical spending on all the 47 Kenyan <strong>counties disaggregated by sector</strong>. The publically available spending data was merged together, even though the disaggregated data is likely to exist. John would like to see better data disaggregation to show all revenue streams into the counties and other sub-national sector spending.</p>\n<p>John and his colleagues are concerned about the <strong>lack of current county-level data on poverty</strong>; the most recent data is from 2005/6. This is a setback for a needs-based allocation of resources for the counties. John would like to see a more robust and up-to-date household survey conducted in Kenya with disaggregated datasets capturing poverty at county level.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/CASE-STUDY-Using-finance-data-for-resource-allocation-Kenya-SHORT-2015-05.pdf\">Download this summary as a pdf</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/CASE-STUDY-Using-finance-data-for-resource-allocation-Kenya-LONG-2015-05.pdf\">Download John Kinuthia\u2019s full story</a></p>\n<h4>Other case studies in this series:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/using-budget-data-to-improve-water-policy-in-nepal-2\" target=\"_blank\">Using budget data to improve water policy in Nepal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/using-foreign-aid-data-to-improve-policy-making-2\" target=\"_blank\">Using foreign aid data to improve policy making</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/opening-public-data-to-improve-government-transparency-in-nepal\" target=\"_blank\">Opening public data to improve government transparency in Nepal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/using-information-about-local-development-projects-to-empower-citizens\">Using information about local development projects to empower citizens in Nepal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/transforming-data-into-useful-information-the-story-of-a-liberian-transparency-advocate\">Transforming data into useful information for transparency advocacy in Liberia</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/using-citizen-generated-data-to-improve-school-performance-in-kenya\" target=\"_blank\">Using citizen-generated data to improve school performance in Kenya</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/using-project-data-to-improve-sexual-health-services-in-kenya\" target=\"_blank\">Using project data to improve sexual health services in Kenya</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Tanzania refugee crisis", "authors": [], "format": "Crisis briefing", "date": "22 May 2015", "description": "On 21 May 2015 we responded to a funding alert in response to the Burundian refugee crisis in Tanzania.

One key area for debate is the situation of least developed countries (LDCs), which face complex challenges in ending poverty and achieving sustainable development, as well as continued resource constraints.</p>\n<p>Social protection* is gaining increasing attention from policymakers, governments and finance providers. \u00a0The proposed sustainable development goals recognise its potential to help \u201cend poverty in all its forms, everywhere\u201d (Goal 1, target 1.3) in a post-2015 world.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Getting-poverty-to-zero.pdf\"><em>Getting poverty to Zero: Financing for social protection in least developed countries</em></a> shows that LDCs face an 88% external finance gap if they are to achieve the scale of social protection coverage needed to end extreme poverty by 2030. \u00a0This suggests that ambitious commitments towards financing social protection from both domestic governments and external finance providers will be\u00a0needed this year if we are to be sure of ending extreme poverty by 2030.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/financing-social-protection-ldcs\">Read our data blog for key graphs and findings</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Getting-poverty-to-zero.pdf\">Read the full report</a></p>\n<p><strong>Key findings:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is growing body of evidence of the impact that social protection has on reducing poverty in countries as diverse as Brazil, Ethiopia, South Africa, Malawi, Kenya, India and Rwanda.</li>\n<li>All countries now have at least one type of social protection programme targeted at the poorest and most vulnerable people. In LDCs, these programmes are only reaching 20% of those living in extreme poverty \u2013 below PPP $1.25 a day.</li>\n<li>Even where extremely poor people are reached, the level of transfer is much less than that needed to sustainably lift poor people out of extreme poverty. In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, the average value of the transfer is 10% of the estimated PPP 42 cents a day needed.</li>\n<li>Current domestic spending on all forms of social protection programmes is on average US$10 per person in LDCs, or just over 1% of GDP. Most LDCs are able to increase their tax revenues and the share of their budget spent on social protection. If all LDCs increased their tax to GDP ratio to 20% (from the current 17%) and allocated 10% to targeted social protection programmes, spending would rise to 2% of GDP, US$16 per person.</li>\n<li>The current average cost of providing the transfer needed to close the extreme poverty gap in LDCs is US$49 per person per year, around 7% of GDP. This is less than the latest estimates for achieving the sustainable development goals for education (US$60) and health (US$86). By contrast, OECD countries\u2019 spending on social protection is significantly more than health and education combined.</li>\n<li>Even if LDCs increase their spending to US$16 per person, there would be a funding gap of US$33 per person. Current DAC donor funding for all forms of social protection-related programmes in LDCs averages US$4 per person per year. As a result 88% of the financing gap is currently unfunded. This compares with recent estimates of the unfunded element for education at 67% and health 50%</li>\n<li>The increase in ODA required to meet financing needs is equivalent to 0.1% of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)\u2019s GNI. Given the priority attached to ending extreme poverty and the limited scope for LDCs to increase their own funding, social protection financing needs should arguably be the first call on increased ODA to ensure the goal of ending poverty is achieved by 2030.</li>\n<li>The data shows that ambitious commitments towards financing social protection from both domestic governments and external finance providers are\u00a0essential this year if we are to be sure of achieving the goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class=\"row--cards\" ng-if=\"post.notes\">\n<div class=\"col-md-12 card m-b--2\">\n<div class=\"card__content bg--light\">\n<h3 class=\"h3\">Notes</h3>\n<div> <p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*Social protection may be defined as \u201cpublic actions \u2013 carried out by the state or privately \u2013 that: a) enable people to deal more effectively with risk and their vulnerability to crises and changes in circumstances (such as unemployment or old age); and b) help tackle extreme and chronic poverty\u201d</p>\n<p><strong><em>\u00a0</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Source </strong></p>\n<p>Department for International Development (DFID). 2006. \u201cSocial protection in poor countries\u201d.

This report looks at the role non-state donors play in the provision of humanitarian assistance \u2013 measuring funding from individuals, trusts and foundations, and companies and corporations \u2013 and assesses where the money comes from, who raises it, and where it is spent. The research draws on a broad set of data sourced directly from humanitarian agencies and covers the period from 2009 to 2013. Private assistance continues to be an important source of funding for humanitarian crises.</p>\n<p>The number, scale and severity of humanitarian crises are outstripping resources. While international humanitarian assistance continues to increase, reaching record levels in 2013, it is still not enough to fully meet needs. Non-state or private donors have long played an important role in supporting the international humanitarian response, and there is currently significant attention being paid to further building the role of these actors.</p>\n<p>The report finds that the volume of private humanitarian assistance given has grown from US$5\u00a0billion in 2012 to US$5.4\u00a0billion in 2013. However, from 2012 to 2013 the proportion of total international humanitarian assistance from private donors fell from 27% to 25%.</p>\n<p><strong>Individuals provide the majority of private funding</strong></p>\n<p>Individuals continue to contribute the overwhelming majority of private funding, providing an estimated 72% (US$3.9 billion) of the total in 2013. Individuals have long been major donors of humanitarian funding, providing an estimated 19% of the total international humanitarian response between 2009 and 2013. One potentially significant area of charitable giving from individuals that has received less attention in discussions around the current humanitarian financing crisis is faith-based giving, and Islamic social finance in particular.

However, from 2012 to 2013 the proportion of total private humanitarian assistance received by UN agencies rose from 5% to 9% and from 3% to 4% for the International Red Cross Red Crescent movement.</p>\n<p><strong>Different expenditure patterns exist between government and private funding</strong></p>\n<p>Our data shows different expenditure patterns between government and private funding for different countries. For example, in 2013 Haiti was the third largest recipient of private funding but was only the 17th largest recipient of government funding. On the other hand, the occupied Palestinian territory was the 3rd largest recipient of bilateral government funding in 2013, but was only the 33rd largest recipient of funding from private donors.</p>\n<p>As our 2014 report\u00a0<em><a href=\"http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/report/humanitarian-assistance-non-state-donors\">Humanitarian assistance from non-state donors: what is it worth?</a></em>\u00a0also showed, while all crises are dependent on donor governments for the majority of humanitarian funding, rapid-onset natural disasters tend to attract a greater proportion of funding from private donors than chronic and conflict-related crises.</p>\n<p><strong>Private donors are diversifying the range of assistance they provide</strong></p>\n<p>Private donors, in particular the private sector, are diversifying the type of support they offer beyond merely financial assistance to include new and innovative forms of in-kind assistance.</p>\n<p>In 2013 private companies and corporations provided an estimated US$385.4\u00a0million in humanitarian funding. Many private sector actors are now moving beyond a direct donorship role towards a \u2018corporate partnership\u2019 approach, providing a range of skills and resources, the financial value of which is often unknown.</p>\n<p><strong>The need for timely and comprehensive data</strong></p>\n<p>Funding from private donors is currently under-reported and there is little information, data or research available on it. Due to this widespread lack of transparency, it is difficult to judge precisely how much is available, where it comes from, who is spending it, on what, or where.</p>\n<p>As the profile, scale and diversity of private contributions to humanitarian assistance grows, so does the importance of being able to track all sources of available funding in order to coordinate the design and delivery of a comprehensive response. Improved and standardised reporting of all forms of assistance \u2013 cash and in-kind, private and government funding \u2013 will help to ensure the transparency, accountability and effective coordination of humanitarian assistance in this new and continually changing landscape.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Global-dataset-2015-ANONYMOUS-FINAL-VALUES.xlsx\">Download the data\u00a0</a></p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Public calls for better data in Nepal", "authors": [], "format": "Briefing", "date": "13 May 2015", "description": "To date, a total of US$156 million in international humanitarian funding has been allocated to the Nepal earthquake crisis according to the UN Office for t", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/public-calls-for-better-data-in-nepal/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"><p>Humanitarian response to the Nepal earthquakes emphasises the need for traceability</p>\n</div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p>To date, a total of US$156 million in international humanitarian funding has been allocated to the Nepal earthquake crisis according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)\u2019s Financial Tracking Service (FTS).

DI\u2019s partner in Nepal through the <a href=\"http://opennepal.net/home\" target=\"_blank\">Open Nepal</a> initiative, <a href=\"http://younginnovations.com.np/\" target=\"_blank\">Young Innovations</a>, has set up a <a href=\"http://earthquake.opennepal.net/\" target=\"_blank\">tool</a> for tracking national and international funding to the crisis and report that an additional US$50 million in funding has also been committed/pledged from national sources to date.</p>\n<p>Over the past couple of weeks since the first major earthquake struck, there has been mounting public demand, particularly in affected districts, for information on how funding \u2013 from both international and national sources \u2013 has been allocated, where it has be channelled and who has received it. See a recent <a href=\"http://opennepal.net/blog/transparency-information-about-earthquake-relief-funds-cornerstone-successful-relief-delivery\" target=\"_blank\">blog from Open Nepal\u2019s Pavitra Rana</a> regarding public demand for better data on funding. The heightened level of accountability resulting from better information on funding would help to ensure that available humanitarian resources are allocated effectively, appropriately and in response to people\u2019s needs.</p>\n<p>Public calls for transparency of international and national funding to the crisis are particularly pertinent in the context of Nepal, given the ongoing recovery from a decade long insurgency. In this context, it is important that humanitarian aid reaches all those in need and in particular the most marginalised groups who are also likely to be most affected by the earthquake.</p>\n<h3><strong>Meeting the demand for better data and traceability of funding to the Nepal crisis</strong></h3>\n<p>The public desire for greater accountability through better data on funding highlights a need for improved local and international mechanisms to trace how and where funding has been allocated, from source to recipient. The current humanitarian situation in Nepal may also provide lessons for the improvement of traceability systems more generally.</p>\n<p>Currently, mechanisms for the traceability of humanitarian assistance are lacking at both national and international levels, representing a critical gap in data on humanitarian financing. UN OCHA\u2019s FTS is the most comprehensive source of available data on humanitarian funding and plays a critical role in tracking international spending in response to individual crises. However, the FTS was designed to track the progress of funding to specific appeals and is not intended to enable funds to be traced through the system once committed \u2013 it shows just the first-level funding recipients rather than the full spectrum of donor to recipient. This makes it impossible to measure what has reached communities and when.</p>\n<h3>So how can this data gap be filled?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The multi-stakeholder <a href=\"http://www.aidtransparency.net/\" target=\"_blank\">International Aid Transparency Initiative</a> (IATI) is one way in which better data and information on humanitarian assistance could be made publically available. Originally designed for development aid, IATI is currently being modified to capture humanitarian assistance. <strong>A humanitarian marker added to the IATI standard </strong>will pave the way for longer term traceability of humanitarian funds at national and international levels. With greater availability, accessibility and use of information such as this, humanitarian actors could coordinate more effectively and enable accountability over the days, weeks, months and years following a disaster. However, although initial discussions around this are in place, the uptake of an IATI humanitarian marker into donor reporting systems will take time.</li>\n<li><strong>Local efforts to trace money are a very important contribution to transparency</strong>. The <a href=\"http://earthquake.opennepal.net/\" target=\"_blank\">portal</a> developed by Young Innovations to track funding could be expanded to report on the amount of pledged funds actually committed and information crowd-sourced on how the funds have been spent. Other important local traceability efforts from those within Nepal\u2019s growing open development community include plans to work with clusters of donors in affected districts, plans to track government disbursements through right-to-information procedures, and plans to gather citizen-generated feedback from local volunteers to ensure accountability of relief expenditure.</li>\n<li>The Government of Nepal is reportedly coordinating the response through the Nepal Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC). <strong>The traceability of funding through the recently established Prime Minister\u2019s Relief Fund is going to be equally important in terms of accountability and meeting the information demands of affected communities</strong>. The government has stated that the details of receipts and expenditures of the Prime Minister\u2019s Disaster Relief Fund will be circulated on a daily basis, and that the fund will be audited annually by the Office of the Auditor General of Nepal. While this is important, and a positive step, annual efforts to audit accounts may not be enough to ensure effective traceability of humanitarian assistance. This raises a challenge for local and international actors to collaborate in joining up reporting systems in appropriate formats to ensure all stakeholders have access to information on how much has been given, where it has gone, how it got there, what it was spent on, and how quickly it was spent.</li>\n<li>Given that some development funds are likely to be channelled to address the longer-term effects of the earthquake \u2013 for example through reconstruction, rehabilitation, and disaster prevention and preparedness efforts \u2013 it is critical that all <strong>development actors involved in the response (both funders and recipient organisations) report to IATI</strong>. At present, the lack of real-time reporting of these funds (e.g. through the OECD creditor reporting system) prevents useful analysis of such funding, but reporting of development assistance through the IATI standard allows some potential.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Lessons for global discussions on the need for greater transparency and data on financing in crisis-affected countries</strong></h3>\n<p>Lessons drawn from the experience of Nepal following the earthquakes on the need for better traceability of funds are relevant to broader global policy discussions currently taking place on effective financing and reporting in crisis-affected countries. These include discussions through the <a href=\"http://www.worldhumanitariansummit.org/\" target=\"_blank\">World Humanitarian Summit (WHS),</a> Financing for Development (FfD), the UN High Level Panel on humanitarian financing, the Inter-Agency Standing Committee Task Team on humanitarian financing and the <a href=\"http://futurehumanitarianfinancing.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Future Humanitarian Financing Initiative</a> (FHF). It is important that in these fora, further commitments are made to improve the traceability of humanitarian and development financing.</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Targeting aid to reach the poorest people: LDC aid trends and targets", "authors": [], "format": "Briefing", "date": "13 May 2015", "description": "Overview \u2018Least developed countries\u2019\u00a0 (LDCs) is a group of currently 48 countries recognised by the UN.

Their status is based on a combination of low income per capita \u2013 central to the income groups often used in aid debates \u2013 and assessments of low human assets and economic vulnerability.</p>\n<p>Remarkable development progress was seen between 1990 and 2010 as extreme poverty rates were halved. But ending poverty is a different challenge that requires a shift in focus away from the world\u2019s poor countries towards its poorest people. Explicitly targeting improvements for and monitoring the progress of the poorest 20% will help mobilise the resources, investments, partnerships and cooperation needed to realise the post- 2015 development agenda and end extreme poverty by 2030. It will also help track whether outcomes are in line with an equitable growth agenda.</p>\n<p>As DI has set out <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/improvingoda2015\">in previous analysis</a>, the existing country-based allocation decision-making criteria for ODA is inadequate, and <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/income-status-basis-aid-allocation-decisions\">needs to become more sophisticated</a>, informed by better sub-national data. ODA should be more tightly focused to where poverty exists within countries.</p>\n<p>But until sub-national data is widely available, a country-level focus remains important. The grouping of LDCs offers a readily available means to guide resource allocation. These countries tend to have: higher proportions of their populations living in poverty \u2013 and this poverty tends to be deeper; low current and projected domestic capacity; and political and environmental vulnerability. These factors support significant long-term investments for LDCs to end poverty globally by 2030.</p>\n<p>A number of options have been proposed for increasing official development assistance (ODA) to LDCs. <a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Targeting-aid-to-reach-the-poorest-people.pdf\" title=\"The briefing\">This briefing</a> quantifies the implications of two proposals:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The target being proposed by the LDCs and other stakeholders, in current negotiations at the UN Finance for Development negotiations that 50% of ODA should be allocated to LDCs;</li>\n<li>The more established target, linked to the 2011 <a href=\"http://unohrlls.org/UserFiles/File/IPoA.pdf\">Istanbul Programme of Action</a> for LDCs- that 0.15\u20130.20% of ODA (as a proportion of DAC donor GNI) should go to LDCs.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We also provide evidence on the trends in ODA to LDCs, a review of the LDCs\u2019 share of total ODA and an analysis of donor forward spending plans in relation to existing allocation patterns.</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Nepal earthquake update", "authors": [], "format": "Crisis briefing", "date": "13 May 2015", "description": "The Nepali government declared a state of emergency in areas affected by the devastating earthquake that struck on 25 April 2015.

It is envisaged the roadmap will help drive its implementation, but regional efforts will need to be supported with concrete actions and political will at a country level. A working session to draft the roadmap is being convened by the UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), from 11 to 13 May 2015, hosted by the Tony Elumelu Foundation in Lagos, Nigeria.</p>\n<h3>Testing a data revolution model</h3>\n<p>In Kenya, Development Initiatives (DI) and Hivos East Africa are engaging a core group of actors on the next practical steps of testing a data revolution model. The core actors are organisations already working at national and sub-national levels (with existing resources to do so) on issues of access to and use of data and information, transparency, accountability, budget advocacy and resources effectiveness. A meeting was held at DI\u2019s Africa Hub office in Nairobi on 22 April to explore how the comparative advantages of these multiple stakeholders (private sector, media, civil society organisations (CSOs), government and techies, etc) could be leveraged to \u201cdomesticate, develop and test a local data revolution model\u201d at the national level and, more importantly, the granular sub-national (county) level in Kenya. The meeting discussed and agreed concrete ideas for county-level work on the Data Revolution.</p>\n<h3>Mobilising stakeholders to achieve common goals</h3>\n<p>There was consensus that the Data Revolution can now be used to mobilise multiple stakeholders towards achieving common goals. There are, however, huge data (and other) gaps that need to be addressed to achieve success. One of the key challenges in this context is that organisations have been working in silos; there is a need to understand what has been achieved so far, and get them to work together in an ecosystem that pools resources, harnesses expertise, and collectively tests and implements ideas. This could either be vertically focusing on different levels (regional, national, sub-national and community) or horizontally across sectors (e.g. health, education and agriculture). It was recognised that the multiplicity of initiatives sometimes presents conflicting positions on similar issues to decision makers and citizens, ultimately creating confusion. A framework is needed that allows different players to complement each other, not compete, therefore introducing consistency.</p>\n<h3>Involving citizens</h3>\n<p>Given the centrality of citizens in this conversation, they need to be actively involved \u2013 empowered by data and information constantly generated from various institutions and programmes. It was clear that strong government ownership both at the national and county levels was paramount. Links need to be established with national level institutions such as the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics to ensure efforts are not disjointed. It was clear that to achieve and sustain the Data Revolution, policies and legal frameworks both at the national and county level would have to change.</p>\n<p>Currently in Kenya counties present a more realistic entry point for testing a model for the Data Revolution, since they are fairly new and open to ideas. Political will is high in some of them and many of the institutional structures are still being established. Citizens also feel a lot closer to decision making institutions, and many organisations are already working at this level on data-related issues. However, the fears and concerns being expressed at the global and regional level are also felt here. The Data Revolution means different things to different people, and questions are being raised about how it will translate to tangible results in the lives of ordinary people \u2013 especially those far away from the conversations. Do they really need to know about it or feel its results and impacts? The key is not to focus on the Data Revolution as a concept but on how it transforms decision making in institutions, improves the way things are done to achieve sustainable results, and empowers citizens to have a say in decisions that impact their lives.</p>\n<h3>Participant concerns</h3>\n<p>We asked those in the meeting what they were most worried about with regard to the Data Revolution. The responses were interesting, as can be seen below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Development and proliferation of bespoke tools, portals and apps that fall short of achieving any meaningful impact in ordinary people\u2019s lives.</li>\n<li>\u201cSpray and pray\u201d \u2013 where all the data is collected/generated and disseminated, but it does not change or influence decision making.</li>\n<li>Lack of government buy-in, political goodwill and commitment \u2013 bureaucracy and initial resistance from some of the key players could sabotage the process.</li>\n<li>Replicating what has already been done, therefore closing out other good ideas/key stakeholders; in particular the Data Revolution becoming a CSO-exclusive activity.</li>\n<li>Lack of capacity for media to effectively tell stories.</li>\n<li>Challenges of ownership, reliability and being afraid to take chances; but also fear to re-work the models/processes if they are not working as earlier anticipated.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>At the county level there is need to focus on simple processes that influence public life, and allow all players to effectively participate. A bold national vision and set of principles on the Data Revolution would be useful in mobilising stakeholders at all levels. The Financing for Development conference in July also provides an opportunity for national governments to make pronouncements committing to the vision and principles of the ADC and the resultant ADC Road Map. This requires clear engagement strategies by CSOs and other stakeholders.</p>\n<h3>Core issues to prioritise</h3>\n<p>To take the conversation forward, a team was nominated to consolidate ideas from the meeting and draft a guiding note. The team met on Friday 24 April and agreed that in line with the ADC the following core issues should be prioritised in testing a data revolution model at the sub-national level in Kenya:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Social, economic and structural transformation that works for citizens. This would be achieved by establishing an inclusive framework that collects, processes and facilitates the dissemination and use of accessible, accurate, credible, timely, user-driven evidence/data/information that is disaggregated to the lowest levels of administration for decision making. Existing national and sub-national strategies for the collection, processing and use of data will have to be revised and expanded to include all forms of data.

In sub-Saharan Africa the transfer is 10% of what is needed.</li>\n<li>The cost of providing the level of transfer needed to close the extreme poverty gap in LDCs is US$49 per person \u2013 taking into account start-up costs, administration costs and leakage. This compares with latest estimates of US$60 for education and US$86 for health sustainable development goals.</li>\n<li>Current expenditure on all forms of social protection programmes is US$10 per person in LDCs. Even if LDCs increased their tax/GDP ratio to 20% and allocated 10% to targeted social protection programmes spending would only be US$16 per person, emphasising the importance of external assistance to support such programmes.</li>\n<li>Current donor funding on all forms of social-protection-related programmes in LDCs is US$3.7 billion \u2013 an average of US$4 per person compared to US$33 per person external financing requirement. Current financing gap to achieve social protection coverage in LDCs at the scale that is needed to eliminate extreme poverty is 88% of the total external finance required, leaving 12% funded. Recent estimates suggest the gap for education is 67% and for health is 50%.</li>\n<li>The increase in official development assistance (ODA) required to meet financing needs is equivalent to 0.1% of OECD GNI.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Nigeria IDPs", "authors": [], "format": "Crisis briefing", "date": "08 Apr 2015", "description": "On 7 April\u00a02015 we responded to a funding alert in response to the\u00a0\u00a0IDPs in Nigeria.

The increase in violence has had a detrimental impact on this complex crisis, with humanitarian access severely constrained by the recent insecurity and many aid agencies have been forced to <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/yemen/11507692/Yemen-nears-total-collapse-as-country-cut-off-from-aid-deliveries.html\">evacuate</a>.</p>\n<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 361 people have been killed and 1,345 injured as result of the recent violence, many of whom are civilians. While currently difficult to quantify the conflict has also led to considerable displacement.

While international humanitarian assistance continues to increase, reaching record levels in 2013, it is still not enough to fully meet needs. This scale of humanitarian needs calls for a different approach to the funding response. New and innovative sources of funding must be found and scaled up, and at the same time existing resources must be used more effectively.</p>\n<p>One potentially significant area of charitable giving that has received relatively little attention in discussions on the current humanitarian financing crisis is faith-based giving, and Islamic financing in particular. <em>An Act of Faith</em> explores the purpose, scale and potential of Zakat \u2013 one of the main tools of Islamic social financing \u2013 for financing humanitarian response. It provides a basis on which to open up discussions around how that potential might be maximised \u2013 both by increasing the overall volume of Zakat collected (rather than redirecting existing funds) and improving the mechanisms available to channel Zakat to the humanitarian response.</p>\n<p>Although interest in Zakat is growing, there has been a lack of data-led evidence of its scale, use and potential. Our research found that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In 2013, faith-based organisations received and delivered between US$420 million and US$434 million (15\u201316%) of all international humanitarian assistance channelled through non-governmental organisations (NGOs).</li>\n<li>The global volume of Zakat collected each year through formal mechanisms is, at the very least, in the tens of billions of dollars. Data collected for Indonesia, Malaysia, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Yemen, which make up 17% of the world\u2019s estimated Muslim population, indicates that in these countries alone at least US$5.7 billion is currently collected in Zakat each year.</li>\n<li>Between 23% and 57% of Zakat currently collected is used for humanitarian assistance, depending on the context in which it is raised and used. It is therefore likely that Zakat is already a significant source of humanitarian financing in many places, and has the potential to provide more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are a number of logistical and ideological questions to address if the potential of Zakat for humanitarian assistance is to be realised. Logistically, who should collect Zakat for humanitarian assistance? How and to what extent should this be formalised? What mechanisms should channel it for humanitarian response? How can conflicting interpretations on who is eligible to receive Zakat be reconciled with each other and with humanitarian principles?</p>\n<p>The report explores these issues and highlights the need for further engagement between humanitarian and Islamic leaders to establish mutual understanding and guidance. This should be the basis for working together to improve channels between Zakat funds and the international humanitarian response system, and for efforts to increase the use of Zakat for humanitarian assistance to be combined with those of the wider development community to ensure complementarity.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/HA-and-Zakat-data-and-graphs-final.xlsx\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Download the data</span></strong></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/GHA_An-Act-of-Faith_Arabic_March-2015.pdf\"><strong>Access\u00a0the executive summary in Arabic</strong></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/An-Act-of-Faith_Arabic_Apr2015.pdf\"><strong>Access the full report in Arabic</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>You can watch the recorded event below</strong></p>\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9e4r8acxuOs\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Transparency in Brazil", "authors": [], "format": "Briefing", "date": "17 Mar 2015", "description": "This brief presents the domestic landscape of transparency in Brazil.

Global incomes have gone up and many countries have seen national income per person rise substantially. But this does not always translate into benefits for the poorest people. The poorest 20% received less than 2% of world income gains over the two decades to 2008.<a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\">[1]</a></p>\n<p>The poorest 20% of people globally includes everyone living below the $1.25-a-day extreme poverty line. It also includes those people who live just above that line and who are vulnerable to falling back under it. Actively prioritising this group\u2019s needs means focusing on them as individuals, moving attention away from a country-driven view of poverty to focus much more locally. It means understanding who the poorest people are, where they live, identifying the challenges and vulnerabilities they face, the resources they have access to and the investments that transform their opportunities. This clearly demands disaggregated data to reveal progress or investment below the national level to what is being invested in the poorest 20%.</p>\n<p>Inequalities of income, opportunity and access to basic services mean that approaches based on average national income cannot provide the data needed for good targeting of scarce resources to end poverty. Focusing on and measuring progress of the poorest 20% also supports global sustainable development ambitions, going beyond the minimum standard of $1.25 a day to sustained progress on ending extreme poverty and reducing inequality. Bringing greater visibility to the status of the poorest 20% of people globally \u2013 their shares of investment received and their progress \u2013 will help to mobilise domestic and international efforts and, end poverty and ensure that no one is left behind.</p>\n<h4>Who are the global poorest 20%?</h4>\n<p>In 2011 there were 1.4 billion people in the global poorest 20%. The best available data for the same year suggest the poorest 20% of people had daily incomes of $1.48 or less.<a href=\"#_edn2\" name=\"_ednref2\">[2]</a></p>\n<p>These figures are derived from the same national household surveys as the $1.25-a-day extreme poverty line, which is based on the national poverty lines of the world\u2019s 15 poorest countries and likely to be core to the post-2015 development agenda.</p>\n<p>The poorest 20% of people live in \u2013 or are highly vulnerable to falling back into \u2013 extreme poverty. Focusing on the poorest 20% therefore helps to achieve the goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030, while establishing a dynamic principle for future sustainable development that evolves with global progress.</p>\n<p>Ending extreme income poverty is important, but it is only a first step. Poverty is multidimensional, although low incomes are very often associated with wider deprivations. Data is currently most readily available on the incomes of the poorest 20%, but more information on the poorest 20% in all dimensions of poverty is needed to understand the wider challenge.</p>\n<h4>Where do the global poorest 20% of people live?</h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/11.png\"><img alt=\"1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8639\" height=\"181\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/11.png\" width=\"628\"/></a></p>\n<p>Two world regions are home to almost four\u2011fifths of the people in the global poorest 20%: South Asia (43%) and sub-Saharan Africa (35%). Three countries account for over half of people in the global poorest 20%: India one third, China one tenth, and Nigeria 8%.</p>\n<h4>People in the global poorest 20% are mostly in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa</h4>\n<p>However, distribution alone is not sufficient to understand the extent of poverty. One third of the poorest 20% of people globally, some 441 million people, live in least developed countries (LDCs). Depth of poverty \u2013 how <em>far below</em> the poverty line poor people\u2019s incomes are \u2013 also tends to be greater for those in the poorest 20% that live in LDCs. All of the 20 countries in with the largest poverty gap are LDCs apart from one, Nigeria.<a href=\"#_edn3\" name=\"_ednref3\">[3]</a> Poverty depths range from 55% in Madagascar to much lower levels of 9% in India and 2% in China, to just 0.1% in Turkey, although even in these countries poverty may still be concentrated in particular states.</p>\n<p>The countries where the global poorest 20% live tend to be low capacity and vulnerable. Some 73% of the poorest 20% live in countries where government spending per person in 2011 was below $1,500 a year, while 28% of the poorest 20% are in countries where the figure is below $500 a year. These compare with $15,700 a year in high-income countries.<a href=\"#_edn4\" name=\"_ednref4\">[4]</a> Nearly all (99%) of the people in the poorest 20% live in countries considered to be environmentally vulnerable, which include China and India, or seen as politically fragile, or both.</p>\n<p>Achieving the end of extreme poverty by 2030 requires attention, investment and data on and from the poorest 20% of people globally and on those in extreme poverty in particular.

Some developing countries would like to learn development lessons from Brazil, whose reputation is that of a democracy that combines political stability, economic growth and poverty reduction. Brazil halved poverty ahead of the Millennium Development Goals deadline and puts eradicating poverty at the centre of its official post-2015 engagement strategy.</p>\n<p>Although Brazil\u2019s economy has worsened, Brazil remains a likely candidate to lead an emerging development agenda from the global South. This briefing maps the landscape of the development cooperation debate in Brazil and argues that, to fully pursue this role, a domestic constituency of support for Brazilian development cooperation is needed.</p>\n<p>A more energetic foreign policy has led to increased domestic attention to development cooperation by Brazil. The community involved is growing, but fragile. The main priority of these stakeholders is to ensure that Brazilian development cooperation, which is largely based on sharing expertise of national policies with other countries, promotes an inclusive and sustainable development model. Their key demands are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A more accountable, functional, transparent and inclusive institutional and legal framework, including the establishment of a multi-stakeholder council of foreign relations</li>\n<li>Clearer alignment between the principles that drive Brazil\u2019s international engagement with its development cooperation practice</li>\n<li>Better information on the impact of Brazilian development cooperation in partner countries</li>\n<li>A more transparent and responsible national development bank, in particular regarding its operations abroad.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Portuguese translation /\u00a0Vers\u00e3o em portugu\u00eas</h3>\n<p>Brazil as an international actor is available in Portuguese</p>\n<p>Download / baixar <a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/O-Brasil-como-ator-internacional.pdf\" title=\"O Brasil como ator internacional\">O Brasil como ator internacional</a></p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Ukraine crisis update", "authors": [], "format": "Crisis briefing", "date": "05 Mar 2015", "description": "Violence broke out in Ukraine in February 2014 and, despite two ceasefires agreed in September 2014 and February 2015, the conflict continues.

It is starting to publish (albeit in pdf format) sub-district data from household surveys in 47 of Uganda\u2019s 112 districts (unfortunately the districts we are working in are not part of their pilot).</li>\n<li>The <strong>Ministry of Finance</strong>, particularly through its <a href=\"http://budget.go.ug/\"><strong>Budget website</strong></a>, produces excellent, disaggregated data; not only financial data, but also district-level work plans and performance reports.</li>\n<li>The <strong>Health Management Information System</strong> (HMIS) and <strong>Education Management Information System</strong> (EMIS) both collect and store a wide range of good, timely data from clinics and schools upwards.</li>\n<li>From anecdotal evidence it appears that data collection carried out by UBOS for the <strong>2014 Census</strong> went very well (with the exception of high-density areas of Kampala).</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://www.uneb.ac.ug/\"><strong>Uganda National Examination Board</strong></a> (UNEB) published authoritative data on all 2014 Primary Leaving Examination (PLE) results within 8 weeks of the exams.</li>\n<li>This wealth of data is atypical of most African countries. Uganda\u2019s priorities are thus different from other countries. A one-size-fits-all data revolution won\u2019t work.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>\u2026 but most of it is not accessible</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>With the exception of District Budgets and the pilot Community Information System, no disaggregated data is readily available.</li>\n<li>The vast majority of data that is accessible is only available in pdf format.</li>\n<li>UNEB sells its data at exorbitant rates (to obtain the complete dataset of 2014 PLE results would cost UGX22 million; that is US$7,000).</li>\n<li>UBOS and other line ministries and agencies generally appear to be committed to the private sharing of data with any institution that formally seeks official approval from the chief executive.</li>\n<li>It is relatively easy, through personal contacts, to obtain data informally through junior officials in the various agencies. While these officials ask that the use of data cannot be traced back to them, the fear level is best described as relaxed. Our experience is that these officials do not risk their positions for personal gain, but because they think that the data they work with should be used more widely.</li>\n<li>Reasons given for not making data accessible include that the integrity of the data is at stake if users can edit and republish it, and that those that need the data already get it through formal relationships and established channels.</li>\n<li>It would be fair to conclude that, in general, Ugandan institutions are committed to the use of their data in both aggregated and disaggregated format, but that their definition of the legitimate user group is a limited one.</li>\n<li>Senior officials, in general, appear not to be persuaded by current thinking on open government and open data. The concept of \u2018open data\u2019 in Uganda currently belongs to civil society.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Experience from the districts</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>In the districts in which we have been working, officials are hungry for meaningful information that will help them improve their performance. They have been keen to engage. They have been open in sharing what data they have. The offer of a district education officer to drive 60km to find an internet connection to send us some data is indicative of the spirit of cooperation that exists.</li>\n<li>Our first attempts at joining up data \u2013 budgets, populations and results \u2013 show that the key to success is deciding what data to select in order to tell meaningful stories. Our first pilots have illustrated that the information we have produced from the selected data do not tell a meaningful story. This is a story in itself.</li>\n<li>We need to listen to the intuitive reasoning and explanations of those working with their problems at first-hand, and then find the right data to confirm or disprove their theories. This is an important lesson we have learned.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Civil registration</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\u201cNo one should be invisible\u201d is how the executive summary of <em>A World That Counts</em> ends. If we don\u2019t know where people are we cannot plan.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://www.ursb.go.ug/\">Uganda Registration Services Bureau</a> (URSB) is an autonomous agency making valiant efforts to improve the registration of births.</li>\n<li>UNICEF has supported the establishment of a <a href=\"http://www.mobilevrs.co.ug/home.php\">Mobile Vital Record Systems</a> (MRVS), which is yielding promising results although it is hampered by insufficient funding and a system design flaw that defines the geographic location of the birth to be the point of registration, not the child\u2019s home.</li>\n<li>It is reasonable to assume that in 10 years time the URSB will be producing credible data on births.</li>\n<li>While it is a legal requirement for Ugandan citizens to register deaths there is, in fact, <strong>no credible data collected on deaths, let alone causes of death.</strong> Nor is there any reason to believe under current priorities that a solution is being seriously considered. The URSB lacks finances. UNICEF has supported registration of births but \u201cis not interested\u201d in deaths. The MRVS has a module for death registration but it is not commissioned.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Causes of death</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Some of the most important data that a health ministry needs to effectively allocate its resources is where and why people die. <strong>Accurate data on mortality does not exist in Uganda</strong>.</li>\n<li>The otherwise excellent HMIS is the main source of data on most causes of death. But it is a facility-based reporting system: many people die at home and even when they do die in a clinic or hospital, reporting the true cause of death (such as maternal mortality) may reflect badly on the facility\u2019s performance.</li>\n<li>Maternal mortality data comes from the Demographic and Health Survey conducted every five years by UBOS. The <a href=\"http://catalog.ihsn.org/index.php/catalog/2965/study-description\">most recent</a>, in 2011, surveyed 10,086 households, interviewing 9,247 women and 2,573 men. There is substantive criticism of this survey being totally unrepresentative.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Counting or calculating: Administrative data or surveys?</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The majority of Ugandan Millennium Development Goal (MDG) Indicators are calculated from Household or Demographic and Health surveys. The proposed draft indicator methodologies for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) continue this practice.</li>\n<li>Both methodologies record the fact that for many indicators administrative data is the preferred option, but the lack of any data (or reliable data) means that surveys are the fallback position.</li>\n<li>While this was perfectly understandable for the MDGs, the SDGs are being developed within the explicit context of the Data Revolution. The SDGs therefore need to do two things:\n<ul>\n<li>Firstly all SDG policies should stress the importance for all countries to prioritise the financing and development of sustainable administrative data systems.</li>\n<li>Secondly, as and when credible administrative data relevant to an SDG indicator becomes available, this data should replace survey data and the indicator should, if necessary, be rebased in light of the more accurate administrative data.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Technology and big data</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Some of the biggest challenges facing a national (not just Kampala-based) Data Revolution in Uganda are electricity supply, internet access and computer equipment.</li>\n<li>Uganda is home to a number of potentially ground-breaking uses of SMS technology, thanks mainly to UNICEF\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/innovation/innovation_73201.html\">Innovation Labs</a>. Usable data from a number of these systems should start becoming available over the next few years.</li>\n<li>The only big datasets that exist in Uganda are those owned by the mobile phone companies. The <a href=\"http://www.unglobalpulse.org/kampala\">UN Global Pulse</a> initiative opened its first African lab in Kampala and is conducting research on population movements. It has also invested in a <a href=\"http://www.unglobalpulse.org/sites/default/files/Food_Security_Brief.pdf\">questionable\u00a0study</a> that uses purchases of mobile airtime credit to assess food security.</li>\n<li>From the above it is reasonable and realistic to assume that big data and high technology solutions are (correctly) way down the list of Uganda\u2019s priorities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3><strong>Recommendations</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Uganda requires major sustainable financial investments in its administrative data systems, particularly for civil registration and vital statistics.</li>\n<li>Any new funding from external sources needs to be channelled through the budget to ensure that donors are kept at arm\u2019s length from the prioritisation of improvements to these systems.</li>\n<li>The budget work of the Ministry of Finance Planning and Economic Development and UBOS\u2019 Community Information System should be championed as examples of best practice.</li>\n<li>The Government of Uganda needs persuading that it is in its own interest to make the wealth of good data that it collects more accessible and usable.</li>\n<li>All actors in the Data Revolution should prioritise the production of good information from available data to build the use case for the government</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3><strong>Disclaimer</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>This is not a comprehensive nor an academic study. It is based on the work we have been doing on our Joined-Up Data Uganda (JUDU) programme, seeking, accessing and appraising data and engaging with a few agencies.</li>\n<li>Our work has to date focussed on demographic, budget, health and education data. Our work focuses on sub-district data in two districts. We have no experience in assessing national datasets of district-level data. I have no knowledge of the state of macro-economic statistics or economic administrative data (agriculture, employment, industry, etc).</li>\n<li>I am not a statistician. <a href=\"http://paris21.org/\">PARIS21</a>\u2018s excellent new <a href=\"http://idr.infocubed.com/\">Metabase</a> is the authoritative source assessing statistical capacity. I am an information architect concerned with the availability of data and its rendering into usable information for national and sub-national decision making.</li>\n<li>I make a number of sweeping observations that, given my limited experience, may be considered presumptuous. I do so deliberately because I think it is the best way to take the debate on the Data Revolution forward.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Nigeria: Boko Haram Insurgency", "authors": [], "format": "Crisis briefing", "date": "16 Feb 2015", "description": "Donors have committed or contributed US$50.1 million in response to the humanitarian needs in Nigeria and surrounding countries in relation to the Boko Har", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/nigeria-boko-haram-insurgency/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"p-t--1 p-b--1 m-b--1\" style=\"border-top:2px solid #f2f2f2; border-bottom:2px solid #f2f2f2;\">\n<div style=\"overflow:hidden;\">\n<div class=\"col-md-7\">\n<div><a class=\"btn btn--dark pdf-download\" ga-event-action=\"pdf-download\" ga-event-category=\"Download\" ga-event-label=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GHA_crisis-briefing_Nigeria_Boko-Haram-1.pdf\" ga-on=\"click\" href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GHA_crisis-briefing_Nigeria_Boko-Haram-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"GHA_crisis-briefing_Nigeria_Boko-Haram\">\n<i class=\"p ss-pdf\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0 GHA_crisis-briefing_Nigeria_Boko-Haram\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"p ss-download\"></i>\n</a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div> Modal <div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"modal pdf-popup\">\n<div class=\"modal-dialog wide\">\n<div class=\"modal-body \">\n<div>\n<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"btn-close\" href=\"#\" id=\"close-pdf-modal\">\u00d7</a>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t          Can we contact you later to ask your opinion about the publication you just downloaded?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf yes, please leave your email below.

Sarala works with community groups to ensure they have access to information, are able to monitor the funding, and are able to have an influence in the projects directly affecting them. She uses the information available from the government, together with observational data collected at a local level, to empower citizens with knowledge. Sarala does this by demonstrating what information they have the right to, and more importantly what having that information can mean. CAHURAST has trained 90 community monitors to access information they are entitled to; for example, they have been shown how to gain access to local government budgets and analyse project documents.</p>\n<h3>Examples of Sarala\u2019s use of information</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Empowering women with information</strong>: When Sarala worked with women in the Dhading District she found that many were unaware that 10% of the Village Development Committee budget should have been allocated towards women\u2019s projects \u2013 an entitlement which, as a result, often did not reach its intended beneficiaries. CAHURAST helped the women to access the budget data so they could trace government expenditure and determine what they were owed. In one instance NPR 200,000 (about US$2,000) that had been identified as missing was reallocated to sewing training for 18 women, increasing their employment potential.</li>\n<li><strong>Engagement with data using technology</strong>: To record the information that was being given by the community monitors, CAHURAST have encouraged the reporting of data through a website application called Development Check. Transforming the way data is collected, stored and communicated has made it more accessible and has stimulated activity around using the information.</li>\n<li><strong>Highlighting discrepancies between project budgets and fund disbursements</strong>: In Gorkha district, community monitors trained by Sarala discovered that half of the budget allocated for a road improvement project had not been disbursed. This had stalled the project, which could only be continued using the personal funds of community members. CAHURAST wrote a report about this, shaped by evidence from the community monitors, which put pressure on the local government to resolve the situation and reimburse the funds. Government officials are now more aware that their conduct is exposed to public scrutiny and that citizens have the power to check their actions, which CAHURAST believes will lead to more cautious and effective spending.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Challenges to Sarala having better information</h3>\n<p>Before the community monitors were trained in data collection approaches, Sarala found that the information gathered was often inaccurate and incomplete, meaning that she had to follow up with the monitors individually. Sarala hopes that the pre-structured questionnaire guiding the entry of information into Development Check will help to improve the data quality.</p>\n<p>In her role of collating the project process information, Sarala has often found that the <strong>data from the ground does not correlate with the data from the local government</strong>. This is because the data from local government lacks detail and disaggregation, preventing its joining up with the citizen generated data. This means that it is harder to check if the intended progress is being made and if the right amount of funding is being provided.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/CASE-STUDY-Using-information-to-empower-citizens-Nepal-SHORT-2015-02.pdf\">Download this summary as a pdf</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/CASE-STUDY-Using-information-to-empower-citizens-Nepal-LONG-2015-02.pdf\">Download Sarala Maharjan\u2019s full story</a></p>\n<h3>Other case studies in this series</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/using-budget-data-to-improve-water-policy-in-nepal-2\">Using budget data to improve water policy in Nepal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/using-foreign-aid-data-to-improve-policy-making-2\">Using foreign aid data to improve policy making</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/opening-public-data-to-improve-government-transparency-in-nepal\">Opening public data to improve government transparency in Nepal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/transforming-data-into-useful-information-the-story-of-a-liberian-transparency-advocate\">Transforming data into useful information for transparency advocacy in Liberia</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/using-public-finance-data-to-monitor-sub-national-resource-allocation-in-kenya\" target=\"_blank\">Using public finance data to monitor sub-national resource allocation in Kenya</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/using-citizen-generated-data-to-improve-school-performance-in-kenya\" target=\"_blank\">Using citizen-generated data to improve school performance in Kenya</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/using-project-data-to-improve-sexual-health-services-in-kenya\" target=\"_blank\">Using project data to improve sexual health services in Kenya</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"h2 m-t--05 m-b--05 ng-binding\">\n</p></div>"}, {"title": "Opening public data to improve government transparency in Nepal", "authors": [], "format": "Case study", "date": "09 Feb 2015", "description": "This profile is part of a series looking at how data is being accessed and used in developing countries Embracing their role as a data intermediary, the gr", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/opening-public-data-to-improve-government-transparency-in-nepal/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"><p><strong>Prakash Neupane </strong>is the ambassador of the Open Knowledge network local group in Nepal \u2013 a group of technology enthusiasts who meet regularly to discuss issues around access to information and open data.</p>\n</div><div class=\"body-text p-b--2\"><p><em>This profile is part of a series looking at how data is being accessed and used in developing countries</em></p>\n<p>Embracing their role as a data intermediary, the group develops technical solutions to open up data around social issues, such as government accountability.

Prakash recognises the importance of publishing budget data in a format that can be shared and used by civil society groups to monitor spending against allocated budgets. He believes that greater access to budget information will improve civil societys ability to monitor funding at a local, national and sector level, and hold government to account. Prakash feels this will lead to more opportunities for civil society to engage in budget decisions, which will help the government to formulate budgets shaped by citizens\u2019 needs.</p>\n<h3><strong>Examples of Prakash\u2019s data use</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Transforming data</strong>: Open Knowledge Nepal held a two-day event \u2013 the \u2018Data Spending Party\u2019 \u2013 in which coders, journalists and students extracted budget and spending data relating to one locality (the Kathmandu Municipality). This involved using computer software to \u2019scrape\u2019 the data and transform it into an open format. The Data Spending Party equipped a range of potential data intermediaries with new data literacy skills. A second data liberation event took the open agenda further, building on the experience from the first event to \u2018scrape\u2019 national budget data. The national budget data was then made available on a public web platform for easy access, analysis and use.</li>\n<li><strong>Analysis to reveal trends in spending over time</strong>: Once the data had been scraped from the PDFs and cleaned in Microsoft Excel, the data could be sorted and filtered, allowing analysis to be carried out. The analysis revealed some interesting trends, for example spending on infrastructure development significantly increased over time, a trend that would have been difficult to identify in the data\u2019s original format.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Challenges to Prakash having better information</strong></h3>\n<p>Because of the team\u2019s initial lack of experience in opening data they had to <strong>learn a process through trial and error, which was time consuming</strong>. They also had to spend time researching appropriate software packages for scraping the data. They have already reused the skills they learned during their first attempts and are now better equipped for future efforts.</p>\n<p>The type of <strong>Nepali font</strong> in which the data was originally published did not meet the Unicode Standard (a character coding system that facilitates the worldwide interchange of text). This caused a number of issues, for example it <strong>could not be easily translated into other languages</strong> and could only be read by computers with the Nepali font installed, which meant that the data was not open to everyone. The group decided that it was important to publish the data in English so that it could reach a wider audience and be utilised by more people, but this process was time consuming.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest issues with the data itself was inconsistencies in the font used in the original government PDF files.

They recently used the data to produce a comprehensive annual report (the Development Co-operation Report), which provides a detailed insight into Nepal\u2019s aid landscape.</p>\n<h4><strong>Examples of Madhu\u2019s Data Use</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Redirection of aid money: </strong>Madhu\u2019s use of aid data in the Development Cooperation Report helped the Nepalese government to understand where aid money was being directed. Upon discovering that aid spending did not correlate with the national priorities outlined in Nepal\u2019s 13th Three Year Plan, the government was able to take action to direct more financial resources towards the areas highlighted in the plan as being important for Nepal\u2019s long-term sustainable development, such as infrastructure and employment creation.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reformation of Nepal\u2019s aid policy</strong>: A new policy (the Development Cooperation Policy, 2014) was created based on the objective evidence that the data provided. Having the data available meant that policy discussions could be led by evidence, and result in forward-looking policies. As well as ensuring that development assistance will align with national priorities, the new policy sets new thresholds for foreign assistance.</li>\n<li><strong>Setting new thresholds for foreign assistance: </strong>One of Madhu\u2019s key findings from the analysis of the aid data was that money was being allocated towards a range of small stand-alone projects, rather than larger and more coherent initiatives (US$959 million was being funnelled into 508 different projects). On reflection of this new information, the Ministry of Finance was able to set minimum thresholds for the amount of foreign assistance that can be used in one project. This means that smaller amounts can be pooled to form larger, integrated projects focused around national priorities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Challenges to Madhu having better information</strong></p>\n<p>Although the AMP gives a broad range of information about foreign assistance in Nepal, <strong>gaps in the data</strong> mean that the complete picture of the aid landscape cannot be fully understood, for example there is little information about the financial flows of international non-governmental organisations (INGOs) and private foundations. These gaps prevent the government from knowing how much money is spent in any given sector, hindering the most effective allocation of their own funds.</p>\n<p>One of the major challenges that the IECCD has faced is that a lot of organisations receiving and providing aid often <strong>lack transparency and accountability mechanisms</strong>, meaning that the information concerning what they do with the money is not available. They are trying to overcome this by registering INGOs with the AMP and training them to provide detailed information about their financial activities.</p>\n<p>Whilst the AMP has helped to collect, host and share the data, the tracking aid flows is still very complex. There is currently <strong>limited technical expertise </strong>in the IECCD to manage the AMP, but it is hoped that sharing and use of the data by a wide range of groups will increase as data literacy and technical expertise is developed over time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/CASE-STUDY-Using-aid-data-for-policy-making-Nepal-SHORT-2015-01.pdf\">Download this summary as a pdf</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/CASE-STUDY-Using-aid-data-for-policy-making-Nepal-LONG-2015-01.pdf\">Download Madhu Marasini\u2019s full story</a></p>\n<p><strong>Other case studies in this serie</strong>s</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/using-budget-data-to-improve-water-policy-in-nepal-2\">Using budget data to improve water policy in Nepal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/transforming-data-into-useful-information-the-story-of-a-liberian-transparency-advocate\">Transforming data into useful information for transparency advocacy in Liberia</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/opening-public-data-to-improve-government-transparency-in-nepal\">Opening public data to improve government transparency in Nepal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/using-information-about-local-development-projects-to-empower-citizens\">Using information about local development projects to empower citizens in Nepal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/using-public-finance-data-to-monitor-sub-national-resource-allocation-in-kenya\" target=\"_blank\">Using public finance data to monitor sub-national resource allocation in Kenya</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/using-citizen-generated-data-to-improve-school-performance-in-kenya\" target=\"_blank\">Using citizen-generated data to improve school performance in Kenya</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/using-project-data-to-improve-sexual-health-services-in-kenya\" target=\"_blank\">Using project data to improve sexual health services in Kenya</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"h2 m-t--05 m-b--05 ng-binding\">\n</p></div>"}, {"title": "Gaza (3rd update)", "authors": [], "format": "Crisis briefing", "date": "29 Jan 2015", "description": "Funding to Gaza has slowed significantly in recent months.

Current projections show that no country where government spending is less than PPP$500 per person will reach PPP$1,000 per person by 2030.</p>\n<h3><strong>Countries with fast-growing domestic resources will face different challenges</strong></h3>\n<p>Government spending will grow more rapidly in other countries \u2013 for example, it is projected to more than double in Indonesia, the Philippines and Viet Nam, and to almost double in India. The challenges for these countries will be in developing the human and technical capacity, and governance systems, to use resources effectively and scale up service provision.</p>\n<p><strong>Figure 2.

Given the centrality of government to the implementation of the post-2015 framework, better data on public spending can benefit many actors, including governments themselves, in allocating resource effectively. For example, data on sub-national spending can help central governments allocate national budgets, as well as donors and civil society working in particular regions. Greater visibility and transparency on public spending can also underpin more effective prioritisation of international resources such as ODA.</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Afghanistan beyond 2014: Aid and the Transformation Decade", "authors": [], "format": "Report", "date": "06 Nov 2014", "description": "Afghanistan has been the focus of large international aid and security investments since the US-led military intervention of 2001.

There have been many major milestones for Afghanistan in 2014, and the country is now on the cusp of what has been termed the \u2018Transformation Decade\u2019 spanning from 2015 to 2024. This period of transition brings with it uncertainty about the future, including the nature of international donor support and the ability of the Afghan state and economy to meet its financing needs.</p>\n<p>This report tracks three major areas of international spending that have a direct bearing on the daily lives of Afghan people: humanitarian, development and security spending. It also considers the domestic economic outlook and the choices donors face in recalibrating their partnerships and investments to protect and build on hard-won development and security gains made since 2001.</p>\n<p>While Afghanistan faces major challenges at the outset of the Transformation Decade, it is within the power of international donor governments to ensure that predictable external financing support to meet humanitarian, development and security needs is not one of them. In addition, there are opportunities for investments to have a greater emphasis on strengthening accountability, with a focus on pro-poor support and resilience building to improve outcomes for Afghan citizens.</p>\n<p>International donors, primarily those involved in the military intervention, have spent significant sums in Afghanistan since 2001. Learning from their involvement over the past 13 years, and paying attention to the particular challenges, needs, and risks of people in Afghanistan at the present juncture, they now have the chance to make conscious and concerted choices to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure predictable and sustained support to both development and the security sector</li>\n<li>Focus on pro-poor development investments and building resilience of populations vulnerable to risk of crisis and disaster</li>\n<li>Continue to support needs-based principled humanitarian response</li>\n<li>Strengthen accountability to reduce the risk of international investments fuelling corruption and conflict.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Download the data in <a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/GHA-Afghanistan_Aid-and-the-Transformation-Decade_Nov-20141.xlsx\">Excel</a> and <a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/GHA-Afghanistan_Aid-and-the-Transformation-Decade_Nov-20141.ods\">Open Document</a> formats.</p>\n<p>We are always pleased to hear from you, so do email us at <a href=\"mailto:gha@devinit.org\">gha@devinit.org</a>\u00a0and share your feedback and ideas for how we can get better data or make it more useful.

Access to information provides people with a base to make better choices and have more control over their lives. Too often attempts to deliver sustainable economic, social and environmental results are hindered by the failure to get the right information, in the right format, to the right people, at the right time. Worse still, the most acute data deficits often affect the people and countries facing the most acute problems.</p>\n<p>The Data Revolution should be about data grounded in real life. Data and information that gets to the people who need it at national and sub-national levels to help with the decisions they face \u2013 hospital directors, school managers, city councillors, parliamentarians. Data that goes beyond averages \u2013 that is disaggregated to show the different impacts of decisions, policies and investments on gender, social groups and people living in different places and over time.</p>\n<p>We need a Data Revolution that sets a new political agenda, that puts existing data to work, that improves the way data is gathered and ensures that information can be used. To deliver this vision, we need the following steps.</p>\n<h3>12 steps to a Data Revolution</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Implement a national \u2018Data Pledge\u2019 to citizens that is supported by governments, private and non-governmental sectors</li>\n<li>Address real world questions with joined up and disaggregated data</li>\n<li>Empower and up-skill data users of the future through education</li>\n<li>Examine existing frameworks and publish existing data</li>\n<li>Build an information bank of data assets</li>\n<li>Allocate funding available for better data according to national and sub-national priorities</li>\n<li>Strengthen national statistical systems\u2019 capacity to collect data</li>\n<li>Implement a policy that data is \u2018open by default\u2019</li>\n<li>Improve data quality by subjecting it to public scrutiny</li>\n<li>Put information users\u2019 needs first</li>\n<li>Recognise technology cannot solve all barriers to information</li>\n<li>Invest in infomediaries\u2019 capacity to translate data into information that policymakers, civil \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 society and the media can actually use</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>It is time for data to become a central building block for better choices.<br/>\nIt is time to put the power of information to work.</strong></p>\n<h3>Setting a new agenda</h3>\n<p>A revolution in the production, access to and use of data demands a new agenda. Without clear political leadership and public commitments to a shared approach, the step-change in capacity for better data at every level will not be delivered. Three core political actions are necessary for the Data Revolution to release the power of information:</p>\n<h4>1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Implement a national \u2018Data Pledge\u2019 to citizens that is supported by governments, private and non-governmental sectors</h4>\n<p>Commitments to better data must primarily be between a government and its people. All governments should make a public \u2018Data Pledge\u2019. Private and non-governmental sectors should follow suit and pledge to support national governments to fulfil the \u2018Data Pledge\u2019.</p>\n<p>The national \u2018<strong>Data Pledge</strong>\u2019 should:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Publicly acknowledge the Data Revolution and the imperative to improve public data for decision-making, accountability and improved service delivery.</li>\n<li>Commit to putting all existing data to work by publishing all data currently in government systems.</li>\n<li>Produce a data investment plan to finance the systems and structures needed to achieve better data through to 2030.</li>\n<li>Adopt a comprehensive and consistent policy for opening up all government data quickly.</li>\n<li>Ensure the data does not become an extractive industry \u2013 extracting information from local populations \u2013 but protects the public\u2019s right to information about their own society by publishing data in a way that is accessible not just to the few but to all.</li>\n<li>Introduce regular consultations with civil society organisations (CSO), local governments and businesses to inform the release of data that meets their needs and enables better participation in local governing processes and decisions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Address real world questions with joined up and disaggregated data</h4>\n<p>Very few datasets tell a story in isolation. Answers to real world questions often need data from different sources to be joined up <strong>and</strong> disaggregated so that the impacts on different people and locations can be traced. Data can only be joined up if it can be compared \u2013 using common definitions and standards. We need urgent political will to establish <strong>basic pillars </strong>for the publication of data for all data publishers to adhere to. To <strong>get beyond the averages</strong> we need a major effort to gather disaggregated data on both the income and wellbeing (in health, education, water and sanitation) of the poorest 20% of people, ensuring no one is left behind.</p>\n<h4>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Empower and upskill data users of the future through education</h4>\n<p>It is not enough to put the data out there: the data needs to be accessible and useable by all sections of society to overcome of the current lack of trust in data: otherwise the Data Revolution risks merely reinforcing the existing power dynamic. We need a widespread education programme that informs people of their access to information rights and empowers them with knowledge and skills to act on those rights.</p>\n<h3>Putting existing data to work</h3>\n<p>Lots of data exists already. Across the world, data availability and quality has improved dramatically during the past two decades. Aggregated development, social and health indicators have been in the public domain for many years. Yet much of the data in most national statistics systems is still private, leaving its economic and social potential untapped.</p>\n<h4>4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Examine existing frameworks and publish existing data</h4>\n<p>The Data Revolution should put to use the large amounts of data that already exist in national statistics and other information systems. Public data should be made public. <strong>All governments</strong> should start by examining the frameworks and publish data that already exists, in as detailed form as possible, with a particular focus on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Administrative and geographic infrastructures</li>\n<li>Budgets and censuses</li>\n<li>Health, education and agricultural data from national management information systems</li>\n<li>All anonymised microdata collected through publicly funded initiatives (such as household surveys)</li>\n<li>Panel data measuring what has happened to the same people over time</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Build an information bank of data assets</h4>\n<p>The private sector has expertise in gathering and using data on its customers, supply chains and the provenance of goods and services. Mobile technologies, internet and social media all create opportunities for gathering and communicating data \u2013 including from people and places that are currently least well served with data. To put these existing data assets to work, they need to be visible. Governments need to provide incentives for open publication of all data from private and public sources. National audits of data assets should be developed, bringing together data that is often held in sectoral silos. The private sector should work in partnership with governments to show how the data they own, such as mobile phone data, could be provided as a public good to complement and improve public data.</p>\n<h3>Gathering better data</h3>\n<h4>6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Allocate funding available for better data according to national and sub-national priorities</h4>\n<p>There are limited resources to improve data and decision makers have different and sometimes conflicting needs. How the limited resources available to improve data are allocated should therefore be determined by national and sub-national priorities of where greatest impact on poverty can be felt. Allocations should not be driven by international commitments or donor requirements.</p>\n<h4>7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Strengthen national statistical systems\u2019 capacity to collect data</h4>\n<p>The challenges for national statistics systems and solutions are now well documented and must be addressed. They should be tackled through actions such as:<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhance the functional autonomy by recognising the national statistical system as an independent function and ensure national statistics offices receive greater independence from political influence.</li>\n<li>Reduce donor dependency and fund national statistics offices more from national budgets, based on the business case for investing in better data.</li>\n<li>Experiment with new institutional models such as public\u2013private partnerships and crowd-sourcing to collect hard-to-get data or outsource data collection activities.</li>\n<li>Build quality control mechanisms into data collection to improve accuracy.</li>\n<li>Improve technical infrastructures for data collection, storage and publishing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Implement a policy that data is \u2018open by default\u2019</h4>\n<p>Where data is available, there are often limitations on how it can be accessed and used. Firstly, data sources are rarely openly licensed, so users are not clear whether they can use and redistribute the data. Secondly, the format is not always machine-readable. Much of the data lives in PDF files or websites. Users need different kinds of information for different purposes, so information needs to be published in a machine-readable format and under open licenses that allow users to access the data and re-purpose it to meet their individual needs.</p>\n<h3>9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Improve data quality by subjecting it to public scrutiny</h3>\n<p>Good quality data \u2013 data that is accurate, complete and timely \u2013 is critical, and data providers should provide mechanisms for data users to feedback and suggest how it can be improved. Too often policy prescriptions fail to alert the reader of the underlying quality of the data. Hence policy makers are not alerted to the poor quality of the data, reducing their incentive to invest in improving it. Data users and policy makers need to adopt a code of practice and <em>always ask, always tell</em> on the provenance and quality of the data.</p>\n<p>Ensuring better information</p>\n<p>How data is produced and used matters for how beneficial it ultimately is. Despite the potential that \u2018more data\u2019 holds, publishing data on its own is not enough. More data does not always mean better information. Data needs combining, contextualising and explaining if it is to be turned into information that elected officials and civil society can act on.</p>\n<h4>10.\u00a0 Put information users\u2019 needs first</h4>\n<p>Data analysis and information delivery must be driven by the needs of national and sub-national decision-makers and those who need to hold them accountable. Too often published data meets the needs of producers rather than users of information, for whom it is inaccessible or too complex. The needs of data users and local decision-makers must be put first by asking themthrough regular consultations what information they need, how they need it, and when.</p>\n<h4>11.\u00a0 Recognise technology cannot solve all barriers to information</h4>\n<p>Getting the right information, in the right format, to right people, at the right time is challenging. Despite legal frameworks for freedom of information or open data, significant technological, human and bureaucratic challenges must still be overcome. These include unstable power supplies, the lack of functioning websites, very limited numbers of information technology specialists or dedicated information officers working in government, cumbersome procedures to access information, and publication in formats that are difficult to disseminate. Addressing these obstacles requires an understanding of the whole data ecosystem \u2013 not just a focus on technological solutions.</p>\n<h4>12.\u00a0 Invest in infomediaries\u2019 capacity to translate data into information that policymakers, civil society and the media can actually use</h4>\n<p>Most \u2018users\u2019 don\u2019t want to handle raw data; they need it translated into accessible information. Open data does not in itself provide usable information. In short, <strong>data is for machines; information is for people</strong>. We need investment to develop and support a cadre of data literate infomediaries \u2013 including government departments, information communication technology, research and non-governmental organisations, and journalists to translate data into a form that policymakers, civil society and the media can actually use.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\">[1]</a> Centre for Global Development and African Population and Health Research Center, Delivering on the Data Revolution in Sub-Saharan Africa, July 2014 <a href=\"http://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/delivering-data-revolution-sub-saharan-africa-pdf.pdf\">www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/delivering-data-revolution-sub-saharan-africa-pdf.pdf</a></p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Global Humanitarian Assistance Report 2014", "authors": [], "format": "Report", "date": "10 Sep 2014", "description": "How much is spent on humanitarian assistance?

Is it enough? Where does it go? How does it get there and what is it spent on? Knowing who is spending what, where, and how is an essential first step in ensuring that resources can best meet the needs of people living in crises \u2013 yet this information is often hard to access.</p>\n<p>To answer these questions, the Global Humanitarian Assistance (GHA) Report 2014 uses unique methodologies to gather and analyse data to provide the most up-to-date and comprehensive picture of global humanitarian financing. We have produced this report annually since 2000, to provide a shared and independent evidence base for anyone engaged in providing, using and understanding assistance in crisis settings.</p>\n<p>The report looks back on an extraordinary year \u2013 in terms of both the scale of high-level crises and in the levels of response \u2013 and sets it in the context of trends in humanitarian assistance. 2013 was marked by high-profile crises in Syria, the Philippines and the Central African Republic, as well as high levels of need both on and off the international radar including in South Sudan, Yemen and the Sahel.</p>\n<p>You can find a summary of our key findings on page 3 of the report and also download the <a href=\"http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/infographics/humanitarian-assistance-in-numbers-2013\">summary infographic</a>. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The level of international humanitarian response rose to a record US$22 billion in 2013. Government donors accounted for three quarters of this, contributing US$16.4 billion \u2013 a rise of 24% from 2012.\u00a0 Private sources provided an estimated US$5.6 billion \u2013 a 35% increase from 2012)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Despite this, over a third of estimated humanitarian needs went unmet: UN-coordinated appeals targeted 78 million people for assistance in 2013 and called for US$13.2 billion in funding.\u00a065% of this funding appeal was met</li>\n<li>78% of humanitarian spending from OECD DAC donors went to protracted emergencies in long- and medium-term recipient countries.

DI surveyed four sub-Saharan African countries on their perception and implementation of the GPEDC. The countries were Burundi, Ghana, Kenya, and Mozambique. In addition, the studies sought to understand the role of the GPEDC in an ever changing global context and this especially in view of the post-2015 development framework that is being considered and developed.</p>\n<h3>The key findings from the all the studies include:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>The Global Partnership has\u00a0</b><b>served as a galvanising tool for multi-stakeholder collaboration</b>\u00a0in a number of countries, notwithstanding the differences in political, economic or other contextual factors. The motivation that has been provided by the Millennium Development Goals, coupled with global campaigns whose sole aim has been to \u2018end poverty\u2019 has not only spurred the wide variety of countries (developing and developed) to seek common solutions, but has also started a process that has brought in a wider array of players, including the private sector, civil society organisations, as well as others.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Membership of the GPEDC makes a difference.</b>\u00a0It doesn\u2019t seem to make that much of a difference if a country is highly or not highly dependent on aid. Good and effective coordination for an effective partnership helps in both situations as exemplified by both Kenya with low aid dependence and Mozambique with relatively high dependence.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As part of sharing the experiences of the case study countries and getting opinion on how to make the GPEDC more effective and relevant to Sub-Saharan Africa, DI\u2019s Africa Hub will be conducting\u00a0 a series of dissemination meetings in Kenya, Mozambique and Ghana.

As a result, aid agencies are looking to a diverse set of new non-state funding sources in both established and emerging economies to fill this gap.</p>\n<p>This report provides a comprehensive picture of non-state humanitarian assistance within this changing context \u2013 measuring funding from individuals, foundations, and companies and corporations \u2013 and assesses who the money comes from, how it is raised, and where it is spent. The research draws on a broad set of data sourced directly from humanitarian agencies, and covers the period from 2008 to 2012.</p>\n<p><strong>Private giving is an important source of funding for humanitarian assistance\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>The report finds that private giving is a growing source of funding for humanitarian assistance. Private funding was an estimated US$4.1 billion in 2012, and over a quarter of all international humanitarian assistance came from private donors between 2008 and 2012. However, both institutional and private contributions have fallen year-on-year since 2010, with private donations falling more steeply (a drop of 26%, compared to a fall of 7% in institutional funding).</p>\n<p><strong>The shifting focus of private fundraising efforts in new and emerging economies</strong></p>\n<p>Humanitarian agencies are stepping up their private fundraising efforts in new and emerging economies, with Asia and the Middle East both playing important roles. For example, in response to Typhoon Haiyan, World Vision Philippines was able to raise US$1.7 million in-country to use for response activities.</p>\n<p><strong>UN agencies are receiving an increasing proportion of funding from private sources, particularly companies and corporations</strong></p>\n<p>While the majority of private funds come from individual donors and are given to non-governmental organisations (NGOs), UN agencies are receiving an increasing proportion of funding from private sources, especially companies and corporations. In 2008, UN agencies received less than 1% of humanitarian funding from private companies, but by 2012 the share of contributions from this group of donors had increased to 15%.</p>\n<p>This is reflected in a wider trend of private companies and corporations beginning to play a more direct role in responding to humanitarian crises beyond financial support \u2013 through skill-sharing, long-term partnerships, and staff volunteering, for example.</p>\n<p><strong>Non-state and institutional donors often support different types of crises</strong></p>\n<p>The report also reveals some startling differences in the types of crises supported by non-state donors. Since 1999, the average funding appeal raised by the UK\u2019s Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) for conflict-related crises was \u00a321 million, while natural disasters raised \u00a367 million on average, over three times more.</p>\n<p>There are also some key differences in terms of where private funds are spent. For example, Haiti dropped in priority for institutional donors in 2012, with only 46% of its Consolidated Appeals Process (CAP) needs met as opposed to 73% the previous year. In the same year, Haiti was the top recipient of private funds according to our data, but was only the 15th highest recipient of bilateral government funding.</p>\n<p><strong>The added value of private funding</strong></p>\n<p>Although private funding amounts to less in terms of volume than funding from institutional donors, it is particularly valuable to humanitarian agencies in terms of its flexibility, reliability and durability. Privately generated funds tend to come with less earmarking and a longer time frame than funding from institutional or state donors.</p>\n<p><strong>The critical need for better data on non-state humanitarian funding</strong></p>\n<p>The lack of available data on private funds is a recurring theme throughout the report. A large group of organisations support GHA\u2019s research in this area by directly providing us with data and information on their private humanitarian funding flows, which we supplement with data taken from publicly available sources such as annual reports. However, this only gives us a partial picture.</p>\n<p>Information on all financial flows needs to be better reported in order to gain a clearer understanding of the total resources available. This would lead to a more coordinated response and help ensure that resources are allocated according to need. To achieve this, and ensure greater accountability, coordination and efficiency in the delivery of humanitarian assistance, all actors \u2013 state and non-state \u2013 should publish their financial information to the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) standard.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Humanitarian-assistance-from-non-state-donors-2014.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Download the report</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Humanitarian-assistance-from-non-state-donors-2014.xlsx\"> Download the data</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Global aid trends \u2013 ODA: what you need to know", "authors": [], "format": "Report", "date": "25 Mar 2014", "description": "Global aid trends: what you need to know.

ODA is unique in its focus on poverty. While the terms are often used interchangeably, <i>aid</i> is the wider range of development assistance of which <i>ODA</i> is one part.</p>\n<p>But there have been calls for a new ODA definition that reflects the changing landscape of aid and the emergence of new providers, including \u2018emerging donors\u2019 (such as China and Saudi Arabia), private organisations, philanthropic foundations and non-governmental organisations. We believe existing aid architecture needs to be updated to meet the challenges of financing the post-2015 development framework.</p>\n<h3>The challenge of meeting the 0.7% target</h3>\n<p>The target of spending 0.7% of gross national income (GNI) on ODA was first adopted in 1970, and reconfirmed many times since, including in 2005 by the 15 EU member states. In 2012 five donors met this target, but as a whole DAC donors achieved only 0.29% of GNI.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 1.17em;\">Growth in global ODA</span></h3>\n<p>Global ODA has grown from around US$40 billion in the 1960s to US$128 billion in 2012. Nearly two-thirds of ODA comes from five G8 countries that are consistently the largest donors by volume: the US, the UK, Germany, France and Japan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h4>ODA has grown to record highs since the 1970s \u2013 but the path has not always been smooth</h4>\n<p><em>Net ODA, 1960\u20132012</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Global-aid-trends-fig-1.png\"><img alt=\"ODA has grown to record highs since the 1970s - but the path has not always been smooth\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3199\" height=\"1094\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Global-aid-trends-fig-1.png\" width=\"1587\"/></a></p>\n<h3>Domestic resources outweigh international flows for most developing countries</h3>\n<p>While ODA is only a small part of the overall picture, it remains the largest international resource flow for 43 countries with over 250 million people living on less than $1.25 a day. The majority of these countries have very low government spending per person. For example, the total reported ODA to Liberia in 2011 exceeded government expenditure. In Rwanda, the value of ODA was equivalent to 80% of total government spending.</p>\n<h3>Bilateral funding varies by sector</h3>\n<p>Aid commitments to the governance and security sectors received the greatest share of bilateral funding in 2011 with 13% of the total, followed by health and infrastructure with 12% each.</p>\n<h3>ODA spending varies by region</h3>\n<p>Sub-Saharan Africa receives the greatest proportion of ODA (35% in 2011), followed by South Asia (17%).

It can be targeted specifically to: support people where governments do not function and markets are not prepared to take risks; support innovation; and leverage other funds. Official development assistance (ODA) is often the largest international resource flow in countries with the lowest government spending.</p>\n<h3>Aid can play different roles</h3>\n<p>Aid can be direct investments targeting people, or indirect investments targeting upstream interventions such as global public goods, research on problems facing developing countries and support to international organisations. Aid can invest in both immediate and longer-term benefits. Some forms of aid do not have strong links to reducing poverty, such as covering costs of international students and supporting refugees in donor countries.</p>\n<p>There are various ways that aid can be delivered, including through cash contributions, loans, commodities such as food aid and staff expertise through technical cooperation. Different forms of aid investments impact on poverty in different ways and each can deliver value. But for the best use of aid, decisions must be driven by need and context.</p>\n<h3>It is not clear who benefits from ODA</h3>\n<p>Current ODA data does not provide adequate disaggregated information on how ODA is allocated and who benefits. A quarter of gross bilateral ODA reported to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC) by its members is recorded as regionally unspecified (approximately US$25 billion). This trend is on the increase among bilateral donors. The UK\u2019s volume of unspecified ODA increased from US$790 million in 2010 to US$2.7 billion in 2011.</p>\n<h3>Aid is not targeted at the poorest people</h3>\n<p>Because of inadequate disaggregated data on who and where poor people are, aid is not effectively targeted at the poorest people. There is little correlation between ODA allocation and where poor people are, with ODA per poor person lowest in the poorest countries.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h4>Redrawing the aid map by ODA per person: the darker the shading, the less ODA per poor person</h4>\n<p><em>ODA per poor person, PPP$, 2011</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Using-data-to-get-better-results-on-poverty-eradication-fig-1.png\"><img alt=\"Using data to get better results on poverty eradication fig 1\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2903\" height=\"634\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Using-data-to-get-better-results-on-poverty-eradication-fig-1.png\" width=\"1205\"/></a></p>\n<p><em>Source: Development Initiatives based on DAC data and World Bank (2013)</em> <em>(see\u00a0<a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Glossary_methodology_abbreviations1.pdf\">methodology</a>)</em>.</p>\n<h2>How to allocate aid to deliver the most impact on reducing poverty</h2>\n<h3>Use sub-national data</h3>\n<p>More and better data supports more transparent choices on investments. Gathering and sharing information on where aid is spent gives recipient communities a chance to feedback to strengthen accountability and provides donors with a coordination framework. People do not benefit equally from growth, so sub-national data on inequalities and resources is critical for aid to be targeted at the poorest people. Geocoding and mapping aid against local distributions of poverty helps to target, coordinate and assess impact.</p>\n<h3>Understand the timeframe of returns on ODA</h3>\n<p>Different types of projects have different timeframes for impacting on poor people. Upfront funding is important for people living in poverty. Information on the time it takes for the benefits to be felt by poor people should be balanced against project impact to inform choices about aid allocation. Appropriate use of \u2018discount rates\u2019 can be used to measure one intervention against another<a href=\"file:///S:/Projects/Investments%20to%20End%20Poverty/Engagement/ITEP%20Summaries/For%20Proofing/ITEP%20Chapter%205%20Summary%2021022014%20final.docx#_ftn1\" title=\"\">[1]</a>. <b></b></p>\n<h3>Consider the probability of impact on poverty reduction</h3>\n<p>A clear idea of who benefits is critical for making choices about the best use of scarce aid resources. This can be achieved by assessing the efficiency of different interventions, such as cost-benefit analysis, while ensuring ODA does not focus on what is easiest to measure.</p>\n<h3>Use aid to leverage other resources</h3>\n<p>Aid can mobilise public-private partnerships and scale-up private investment. It can build bridges between poor people and existing resources, enable governments\u2019 to mobilise domestic revenues and work directly with other financing to increase the volume of resources for ending poverty. But blending aid with other sources of finance is not a panacea and success is not automatic. Different actors need to harmonise their priorities around poor people\u2019s needs if leveraged finance is to help reduce poverty.</p>\n<h3>Ensure that the aid instruments being used are appropriate to the context</h3>\n<p>Aid should be neutral and reflect the needs and priorities of poor people above the donor. US$27 billion of aid is \u2018tied or partially-tied\u2019, usually to procurement practices, where recipients must buy goods and services from the donor country. Tied aid inflates project costs by 15-30% and regularly goes unreported. Loans are often considered appropriate for wealthier countries and productive sectors that will generate financial returns. But in 2011, US$3.6 billion was lent to countries at moderate risk of debt distress, and 30% of lending went to social sectors in 2012, despite the lack of revenues to service loans. The choice between the use of aid and other official financing instruments should be determined by what is most appropriate for achieving the desired goal, not what is politically expedient.</p>\n<div><br clear=\"all\"/>\n<hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"/>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"file:///S:/Projects/Investments%20to%20End%20Poverty/Engagement/ITEP%20Summaries/For%20Proofing/ITEP%20Chapter%205%20Summary%2021022014%20final.docx#_ftnref1\" title=\"\">[1]</a> The higher the discount rate, the faster the value of every dollar is seen to diminish.

Government spending per person is lowest in sub-Saharan Africa, South and South-East Asia.</p>\n<h3>Countries with the lowest domestic spending are home to the world\u2019s poorest people</h3>\n<p>Some 82% of the world\u2019s extremely poor people live in countries where government spending is less than PPP$1,000 per person per year, compared with PPP$15,025 across OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) countries. More than 100 million people in extreme poverty live in countries where it is less than PPP$200.</p>\n<h3>ODA will continue to play a critical role in the poorest countries</h3>\n<p>Official development assistance (ODA) remains the largest resource flow for most countries with the lowest domestic resources. It accounts for almost two-thirds of flows to countries with government spending of less than PPP$200 per person each year. In contrast, most foreign direct investment (FDI) is received by countries with more domestic resources and lower poverty rates.</p>\n<h3>Future growth in government spending per person is likely to vary by country</h3>\n<p>Although government resources per person are expected to grow in almost all developing countries, rates will vary. Estimates suggest that the developing countries with the lowest government spending will see the slowest growth in spending. Even countries with rapidly growing resources are starting from a low base and may face non-financial challenges to deliver basic services.</p>\n<h3>International resource flows are increasingly diverse</h3>\n<p>Shifts in international resource flows since 1990 have been driven by growth in FDI and remittances. Disbursements of long-term loans account for the largest resource flows to developing countries in 2011, totalling US$530 billion, followed by FDI (US$472 billion) and remittances (US$343 billion). Gross ODA totalled US$149 billion in 2011. But the mix of resources flowing to developing countries has changed dramatically. In 1990, gross ODA from all donors was the largest resource flow for 95 developing countries, but by 2011 this had halved to just 43.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h4>International resource flows to developing countries have grown rapidly</h4>\n<h4><em><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u00a0US$ trillions, 2011</span></em></h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Using-all-resources-available-to-end-poverty-fig-1.png\"><img alt=\"Using all resources available to end poverty fig 1\" height=\"404\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Using-all-resources-available-to-end-poverty-fig-1-1024x680.png\" width=\"608\"/></a></p>\n<p><em>Source: Based on data from a wide range of sources (see <a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Glossary_methodology_abbreviations1.pdf\">methodology</a>).</em></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 1.17em;\">Outflows are as important as inflows</span></h3>\n<p>Large volumes of resources leave developing countries and these are largely not productive investments in other countries, but reverse flows in the form of repayments on loans or returns on investments leaving the country.

These five are consistently the largest donors by volume only Germany among them did not reduce ODA levels between 2010 and 2012. The 15 largest donors account for 95% of ODA. However, although the US and Japan, in terms volume, provide significant amounts of ODA, they have low aid to GNI ratios (0.19% and 0.17% respectively) and also allocate smaller proportions of public expenditure to ODA.

Countries including Korea, which used to receive ODA, have now become significant donors. Indeed, according to 2012 OECD DAC data, the volume of ODA from Korea in 2012 surpassed that of Finland, Austria and Ireland after a threefold increase over the last decade. Several countries which are not DAC members also report ODA to the DAC. Moreover, 50 countries which are on the list of ODA recipients also provided aid to the UN Financial Tracking Service (a global database which records all reported international humanitarian aid) in 2011, while 125 countries have contributed to the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (a coordinated pool of funds for humanitarian action) since 2006, including ODA recipients Bangladesh, Ghana and Mozambique.</p>\n<p><b>Sub-Saharan Africa received almost US$ 47 billion in 2011\u00a0</b><b>\u00a0</b><b>\u00a0</b></p>\n<p>Not only was sub-Saharan Africa the region that received most ODA in 2011 with 35% of net ODA, but twelve of the 20 largest aid recipient countries are in this region. \u00a0About 17% of ODA is allocated to South and Central Asia, and Afghanistan was the largest overall recipient of ODA. However, over the last decade the largest increases in ODA were seen in the Middle East. This growth was mainly driven by aid to Iraq which peaked at US$30 billion in 2005, although it has fallen back again since. The volume of ODA received has remained relatively constant in Oceania, North Africa, South America and Europe, while they have fallen slightly in East Asia.

Although the environmental and water and sanitation sectors grew quickly in terms of ODA funding (213% and 138%), these two remained the smallest aid sectors accounting for only 3% and 4% respectively. Overall, agriculture receives the lowest amount of ODA. Regional variations in ODA allocation by sector are significant. For example, in Sub-Saharan the share of ODA to health is twice that of governance and security, while governance and security is the largest sector in the Middle East. The United States is the largest bilateral donor to health, disbursing more than US$7 billion in 2011, 23% of its bilateral aid.<b>\u00a0</b>The United Kingdom was the second largest bilateral donor to health, contributing more than US$1.5 billion in 2011, 12% of its bilateral aid.

The US stated that it did not subscribe to specific targets or timetables, although it supported the resolution\u2019s more general aims. Also, Switzerland \u2013 which joined the UN in 2002 \u2013 did not adopt the target. Prior to 1993, gross national product (GNP) was used, but a change to international economic accounting saw this substituted with gross national income (GNI).</p>\n<h4>Only six countries have ever met the target, and the OECD average has never exceeded 0.4%.</h4>\n<p>The first countries met the target in 1975 Sweden \u00a0(which has met it in 1974 before GNP revisions saw it fall just short) and, , the Netherlands. Norway and Denmark reached it in 1976 and 1978 respectively. These four countries have continued to meet the 0.7% since. Finland achieved the target in one year, 1991, and Luxembourg has met it since 2000. \u00a0The UK is expected to join this group and meet the 0.7% target in 2013. While some countries, including France had met the target in years before the threshold was set, no other DAC country has met the target since it was established.\u00a0<i><br/>\n</i></p>\n<h4>Sweden, Norway, Luxembourg, Denmark and the Netherlands have all consistently reached or exceeded the 0.7% target.</h4>\n<p>While many countries have not met the original 0.7% commitment, some have made various national commitments to reach this or other levels. For example, the EU has pledged to meet 0.7% by 2015, while Australia has pledged to reach 0.5% by 2017/2018 (though the recently elected government is yet to announce its plans).</p>\n<p>Sweden, Norway, Luxembourg and Denmark have also consistently exceeded their own national targets (of 1%). By contrast Greece, Italy, Spain, Japan and the US give less than 0.2% in aid \u2013 as does Korea, although it only joined the DAC in 2010 and has set a national target of 0.25% by 2015.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/di-charting-oda-poverty-172-910x462.png\"><img alt=\"Charting ODA\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-1143\" height=\"462\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/di-charting-oda-poverty-172-910x462.png\" width=\"910\"/></a></p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\n<i></i></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Counting humanitarian aid delivered through the military", "authors": [], "format": "Briefing", "date": "21 Aug 2013", "description": "The last decade has seen an increased prevalence and normalised involvement of military actors in the delivery of humanitarian assistance.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/counting-the-cost-of-humanitarian-aid-delivered-through-the-military/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"p-t--1 p-b--1 m-b--1\" style=\"border-top:2px solid #f2f2f2; border-bottom:2px solid #f2f2f2;\">\n<div style=\"overflow:hidden;\">\n<div class=\"col-md-7\">\n<div><a class=\"btn btn--dark pdf-download\" ga-event-action=\"pdf-download\" ga-event-category=\"Download\" ga-event-label=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gha-2013-briefing-military-involvement-humanitarian-aid.pdf\" ga-on=\"click\" href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gha-2013-briefing-military-involvement-humanitarian-aid.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"gha-2013-briefing-military-involvement-humanitarian-aid\">\n<i class=\"p ss-pdf\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0 gha-2013-briefing-military-involvement-humanitarian-aid\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"p ss-download\"></i>\n</a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div> Modal <div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"modal pdf-popup\">\n<div class=\"modal-dialog wide\">\n<div class=\"modal-body \">\n<div>\n<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"btn-close\" href=\"#\" id=\"close-pdf-modal\">\u00d7</a>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t          Can we contact you later to ask your opinion about the publication you just downloaded?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf yes, please leave your email below.

This includes companies, foundations and individuals, and uses financial information from our unique study set of 78 international NGOs, as well as Red Cross and UN agencies. We look at where private financing comes from, where it gets spent and its role in international humanitarian response.</p>\n<p>The effects of the global economic crisis started to show for the first time in international aid budgets in 2011. Bilateral official development assistance (ODA) from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC) countries saw its first decrease since 1997, and bilateral humanitarian assistance also reduced. In 2012, both ODA and humanitarian assistance have continued falling, as more donors restrict their budgets. On the other hand, 2011 saw a severe food insecurity crisis in the Horn of Africa region, as well as heavy flooding in Pakistan and Central America. Yet the 2011 United Nation\u2019s (UN) Consolidated Appeal Process (CAP) presented its lowest level of needs met in a decade. Following a record year of private humanitarian fundraising in 2010, this begged the question: in times of reduced government aid budgets, can private funding \u201cfill the gap\u201d? We examine trends in private humanitarian funding using data and information provided to us by some of the biggest agencies, in an attempt to answer this question and to quantify levels of private humanitarian funding worldwide.</p>\n<p>The report also discusses the relative lack of transparency in private funding compared with government and institutional funding, and considers ways to improve reporting. We believe a clearer picture of all resources available for funding humanitarian response would result in more effective use of the money available.</p>\n<p>This report was produced by our <a href=\"http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/\">Global Humanitarian Assistance</a> (GHA) programme and can be accessed <a href=\"http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/report/private-funding-for-humanitarian-assistance\">here</a>.</p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Global Humanitarian Assistance Report 2013", "authors": [], "format": "Report", "date": "12 Jul 2013", "description": "This tenth edition of the report provides the most up-to-date and comprehensive picture of global humanitarian financing, and describes some of the key trends and developments of the last decade.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/gha-report-2013/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"p-t--1 p-b--1 m-b--1\" style=\"border-top:2px solid #f2f2f2; border-bottom:2px solid #f2f2f2;\">\n<div style=\"overflow:hidden;\">\n<div class=\"col-md-7\">\n<div><a class=\"btn btn--dark pdf-download\" ga-event-action=\"pdf-download\" ga-event-category=\"Download\" ga-event-label=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Global-Humanitarian-Assistance-Report-2013.pdf\" ga-on=\"click\" href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Global-Humanitarian-Assistance-Report-2013.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Global Humanitarian Assistance Report 2013\">\n<i class=\"p ss-pdf\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0 Global Humanitarian Assistance Report 2013\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"p ss-download\"></i>\n</a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div> Modal <div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"modal pdf-popup\">\n<div class=\"modal-dialog wide\">\n<div class=\"modal-body \">\n<div>\n<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"btn-close\" href=\"#\" id=\"close-pdf-modal\">\u00d7</a>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t          Can we contact you later to ask your opinion about the publication you just downloaded?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf yes, please leave your email below.

Who provides it? Who implements it? Where does it go and what is spent on?</h3>\n<p>Official development assistance (ODA) is official funding provided by governments and official agencies in the 23 countries that are members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Development Assistance Committee (DAC) and the European Commission. The DAC has strict qualifying criteria focused around two key principals: the primary objective must be the welfare and economic development of developing countries; and assistance must be concessional either through the provision of grants or soft loans. The overall picture of ODA funding is complex involving many organisations at multilateral, country and local level. Development Initiatives is providing new analysis to improve understanding of what is given and how it is spent.</p>\n<h3>You can read the full report\u00a0<a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/di-data-guides-oda-09-10-12-E.pdf\" title=\"#\">here</a></h3>\n<h3>Key findings include:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Net ODA grew by 63% (almost US$50 billion) over the last decade, reaching a peak of US$128.5 billion in 2010. Volumes fell 2.7% in 2011 (US$3.4 billion) to a preliminary US$125.1 billion in 2011 (constant prices).</li>\n<li>ODA constitutes 7% of an estimated minimum of US$1.7 trillion of international resource flows to developing countries. These include other forms of official financing, public and private borrowing, foreign direct investment and other capital flows, remittances and aid from all countries outside the OECD DAC membership group, together with assistance from international NGOs and foundations. At US$4.8 trillion, developing countries\u2019 own domestic budgets are some 2.8 times greater than all external flows combined.</li>\n<li>The United States is the largest donor, disbursing an annual average of almost US$30 billion over 2009\u20132011. Together with Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Japan, these five countries provide almost two-thirds of ODA. The EU and the World Bank\u2019s International Development Agency (IDA) deliver almost 60% of ODA disbursed by multilateral agencies and are among the largest individual donors when compared against the bilateral disbursements of country donors. As a group, the United Nations (UN) received the largest amount of ODA disbursed to multilateral agencies through core and earmarked contributions combined. Together, the UN, World Bank group and EU institutions accounted for 78.5% of ODA to multilateral agencies in 2008-10.</li>\n<li>DAC donors collectively allocated 0.31% of gross national income (GNI) to ODA in 2011. The 15 EU member states that have committed to reach the international 0.7% GNI target by 2015 allocated 0.47%. Five countries \u2013 Sweden, Norway, Luxembourg, Denmark and the Netherlands \u2013 have reached, sustained or exceeded the target, a number of them for decades.</li>\n<li>As a group, DAC donors contributed 0.73% of government expenditure to ODA in 2010. The donors that contribute higher proportions of national income to ODA also allocate larger proportions of government expenditure to aid and have higher levels of aid spending per head of population. A different set of donors perform poorly across all three of these measures.</li>\n<li>Approximately 40% of ODA is spent through donor and developing country public sectors. Another 40% is channelled through multilateral agencies, of which a third is earmarked for a specific purpose or country. The remaining two-thirds constitutes core contributions to multilateral agencies (termed \u2018multilateral ODA\u2019 by the OECD DAC), with decisions on spending made by the multilateral organisation itself. EU institutions are the largest recipient of core multilateral ODA, receiving an average US$13.2 billion a year over 2009\u20132011. Core contributions to the World Bank (IDA) have grown by 63% during the last decade. IDA received an average of US$7.8 billion a year during 2008\u20132010 \u2013 the second largest multilateral recipient after the EU.</li>\n<li>Sub-Saharan Africa receives more ODA than any other region with volumes reaching US$45 billion in 2010 and ODA per poor person averaging US$97 a year over 2008-2010. The equivalent per poor person volume in Asia is US$41, because of the high absolute numbers of people living below US$1.25 a day. While regions such as Europe, the Middle East and North Africa receive lower volumes of ODA overall, small poverty populations in those regions means that the equivalent amount of ODA per poor person is many times higher, reaching US$27,993, US$1,164 and US$611 per poor person respectively.</li>\n<li>Least developed countries (LDCs) now account for 45% of ODA disbursements and ODA to this group grew at twice the rate of ODA overall during the last decade.</li>\n<li>Afghanistan and Iraq have been regular top recipients of ODA over the last decade, receiving the highest volumes of ODA across 2009\u20132011. India and China, both middle income countries but with very large numbers of people living in extreme poverty, have also been significant recipients. Their ODA per poor person averages around US$6 a year \u2013 lower than any other country.</li>\n<li>Since the early 1970s, growth in ODA has largely been driven by an increase in grant-making. Almost four-fifths of ODA is now delivered as grants with 19% delivered as loans.</li>\n<li>Grants comprise a wide variety of aid instruments, the largest being financial transfers supporting projects and programmes (29% of all grants in 2010). Grants can also be delivered in kind, the largest being technical cooperation, such as the provision of people and expertise, which accounted for 18% of all grants and 14% of total ODA disbursements in 2010. Budget support, where the donor relinquishes control of the funds to allow the recipient government to spend the ODA according to its own priorities, reached US$12 billion in 2010, more than 8% of total ODA. Half of this was earmarked for a specific sector.</li>\n<li>ODA supports a wide range of sectors from social development and economic production, to governance, conflict prevention and emergency assistance. ODA supporting governance and a wider enabling environment accounted for 15% of all disbursements during 2008\u20132010. Health and infrastructure each represent over 10% of disbursements, with volumes more than doubling over the decade. Health ODA has grown particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, almost doubling its share of total ODA to the region since 2002\u20132004, to reach 18% by 2008\u20132010, and accounting for more than half of all global health ODA.</li>\n<li>ODA for sectors with large capital costs such as infrastructure and water and sanitation relies substantially more on loans for financing (61% and 45% respectively) compared to other sectors, while ODA for health, food security and social protection and conflict and emergency is delivered almost completely as grants. Equity investments are directed largely at productive sectors (e.g. agriculture, and industry).</li>\n<li>Donors prioritise sectors differently. The United States, for example, allocates 23% of its bilateral ODA to health (excluding contributions to vertical funds and multilateral agencies) and is by far the largest donor to the sector with bilateral contributions reaching almost US$6 billion a year (2008\u20132010). IDA is the largest disburser of agricultural aid (followed by Japan), and allocates almost 13% of its ODA budget to the sector.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Kenya: resources for poverty eradication", "authors": [], "format": "Report", "date": "21 Sep 2012", "description": "This paper provides an analysis of the Kenyan Government's public expenditure in and donor contributions to, the education, health and agriculture sectors.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/kenya-resources-for-poverty-eradication/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"p-t--1 p-b--1 m-b--1\" style=\"border-top:2px solid #f2f2f2; border-bottom:2px solid #f2f2f2;\">\n<div style=\"overflow:hidden;\">\n<div class=\"col-md-7\">\n<div><a class=\"btn btn--dark pdf-download\" ga-event-action=\"pdf-download\" ga-event-category=\"Download\" ga-event-label=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Kenya.pdf\" ga-on=\"click\" href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Kenya.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Kenya\">\n<i class=\"p ss-pdf\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0 Kenya\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i class=\"p ss-download\"></i>\n</a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div> Modal <div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"modal pdf-popup\">\n<div class=\"modal-dialog wide\">\n<div class=\"modal-body \">\n<div>\n<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"btn-close\" href=\"#\" id=\"close-pdf-modal\">\u00d7</a>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t          Can we contact you later to ask your opinion about the publication you just downloaded?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf yes, please leave your email below.

It considers how this response has measured up to the scale of global humanitarian crises and reflects on the timeliness, proportionality, and phasing of investments. Chapters on humanitarian funding (the donors, recipients and channels of delivery), the forces which shape humanitarian need, and the investments needed to tackle vulnerability are presented, revealing the complexity of humanitarian response.</p>\n<p>In 2010 major natural disasters in Haiti and Pakistan had wide-ranging effects on the collective humanitarian response: driving up overall international spending by 23% over the previous year; drawing in new government and private donors; and involving military actors in responses on a huge; scale. These crises also shifted historic geographical concentrations of humanitarian spending, exacerbating the gap in unmet financing for a number of other countries.</p>\n<p>In 2011 global humanitarian needs were smaller in scale, with the UN\u2019s consolidated humanitarian appeal requesting US$8.9 billion, 21% less in financing, to meet the humanitarian needs of 62 million people, compared with US$11.3 billion requested to meet the needs of 74 million people in 2010. The overall international humanitarian financing response fell back by 9%, from US$18.8 billion in 2010 to US$17.1 billion in 2011. But despite the reduction in needs in the UN\u2019s humanitarian appeals, the gap in unmet financing widened to levels not seen in ten years.</p>\n<p>Humanitarian crises not only occur in parts of the world where many people are already poor: they deepen poverty and prevent people from escaping from it. Building resilience to shock and disaster risk therefore is not only the concern of affected communities and humanitarians; it is of fundamental importance in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and in the elimination of absolute poverty.</p>\n<p>You can read blogs about GHA Report 2012 from <a href=\"http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/?p=3681\" title=\"Ed Cairns blog\">Ed Cairns (Senior Policy Adviser at Oxfam GB)</a> and <a href=\"http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/gha-report-2012-reflections-from-peter-walker-3693.html\" title=\"Peter Walker blog\">Peter Walker (Director of Feinstein International Centre)</a>.</p>\n<p>You can also access:</p>\n<p>\u2013 Chapter-by-chapter data available for download here.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/gha-2012-chapter-1.xls\" title=\"Chapter 1 - Humanitarian response to crises\">Chapter 1 \u2013 Humanitarian response to crises</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/gha-2012-chapter-2.xls\" title=\"Chapter 2 - Forces shaping humanitarian need\">Chapter 2 \u2013 Forces shaping humanitarian need</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/gha-2012-chapter-3.xls\" title=\"Chapter 3 - Investments to tackle vulnerability\">Chapter 3 \u2013 Investments to tackle vulnerability</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/gha-2012-reference-tables.xls\" title=\"GHA 2012 - Reference tables\">GHA 2012 \u2013 Reference tables</a></strong></p>\n<p>\u2013 The infographics and images from the report on the Development Initiatives Flickr site here.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://flic.kr/s/aHsjALpENw\" title=\"GHA 2012 report infographics\"><strong>GHA 2012 report infographics</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/development_initiatives/sets/72157630635376932/\" title=\"GHA 2012 report images\">GHA 2012 report images</a></strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Global-Humanitarian-Assistance-Report-2012.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Download the full report</a></strong></p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Private funding: An emerging trend in humanitarian donorship", "authors": [], "format": "Report", "date": "12 Apr 2012", "description": "This report analyses the emerging role of private voluntary contributions in humanitarian donorship.

Needs are increasing, and commodity prices remain at near-record highs.\u00a0 There is pressure on donors either to reduce their humanitarian expenditures or at the very least, more than before, to justify the value in each dollar spent. This is in a context of mega-disasters on an almost unheard of scale and continual expenditures of vast sums in complex emergencies.</p>\n<p>Questions are posed about the adequacy and equity of this funding, and whether it is being appropriately directed to meet needs. All this is in the context of a current model of year-on-year increase of humanitarian expenditure in the same countries, and<i>\u00a0</i>a humanitarian system which is increasingly under pressure. The sustainability of this is questionable.</p>\n<p>In this report we examine the top 40 humanitarian recipient countries in the context of natural disasters and especially with regard to financing to reduce risk.

Millions of people in sub-Saharan Africa are living with conflict and its legacy; natural disasters such as the earthquake in Haiti and the floods in Pakistan have the power to disrupt and sometimes even paralyse economic and social infrastructure; recovery and reconstruction remain uneven following large-scale conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan; and political turmoil is escalating in parts of the Middle East and North Africa. In many instances the people already affected by crises face additional threats, their livelihoods made more insecure by the effects of climate change and the vagaries of the global economy.</p>\n<p>The international humanitarian response to these needs reached US$16.7 billion in 2010. If this preliminary, partial estimate proves to be accurate when full final data is available, it will have been the largest annual humanitarian response on record \u2013 higher even than in 2005, the year of the Indian Ocean earthquake/tsunami and the South Asia (Kashmir) earthquake. However, while the contributions of governments outside of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC) and those of the private sector increased dramatically in 2010, it is not clear whether these actors will become regular donors in years when there are no major natural disasters.</p>\n<p>The overall humanitarian expenditure of OECD DAC member governments \u2013 the major contributors to ongoing crises \u2013 is also estimated to have increased in 2010. But this is underpinned by substantial increases by just three donors: the United States (US$430 million), Japan (US$275 million) and Canada (US$129 million). While the overall international response to humanitarian crises shows an upward trend, many donors are coming under pressure to justify existing levels of aid spending. Eight OECD DAC members look set to reduce their levels of expenditure for the third consecutive year in 2010.</p>\n<p>In a global context of rising demand, escalating costs and budgetary constraints, the need to target humanitarian financing effectively and equitably is ever more compelling. In 2010, the level of needs that were unmet in the UN\u2019s consolidated appeals process (CAP) rose to 37% (US$4.2 billion), compared with an average of 30.2% in the five preceding years. Moreover, humanitarian funding seems to have been more unevenly distributed across crises in 2010, with complex emergencies in many cases receiving a lower proportion of their funding requirements.</p>\n<p>The effective targeting of humanitarian financing must include the effective coordination of all resources to address vulnerability to crises \u2013 while it remains important for humanitarian aid to be independent, neutral and based on need alone, it does not exist in a vacuum. Does it make sense for humanitarian assistance, which in many cases is being spent year on year in the same places, to be looked at in isolation from other types of potential funding?</p>\n<p>To read about our partners\u2019 opinions on GHA Report 2011, see blogs from <a href=\"http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/john-mitchells-response-to-the-gha-report-2011-3066.html\">John Mitchell</a> (Director of <a href=\"http://www.alnap.org/\">ALNAP</a>), <a href=\"http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/philip-tammingas-response-to-the-gha-report-2011-3070.html\">Philip Tamminga</a> (Head of the Humanitarian Response Index at <a href=\"http://daraint.org/\">DARA</a>) and <a href=\"http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/tim-larges-response-to-the-gha-report-2011-3073.html\">Tim Large</a> (Editor-in-Chief at <a href=\"http://www.trust.org/alertnet\">AlertNet</a>, Thomson Reuters Foundation).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Global-Humanitarian-Assistance-Report-2011.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Download the report</a></p>\n</div>"}, {"title": "Shifting structures, changing trends: non-DAC donors and humanitarian aid", "authors": [], "format": "Report", "date": "13 Jul 2011", "description": "This report analyses the changing patterns in non-DAC donor development and humanitarian financing, focusing specifically on the key players and the changi", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/non-dac-donors-and-humanitarian-aid/", "body": "<div class=\"lead\"></div><div class=\"p-t--1 p-b--1 m-b--1\" style=\"border-top:2px solid #f2f2f2; border-bottom:2px solid #f2f2f2;\">\n<div style=\"overflow:hidden;\">\n<div class=\"col-md-7\">\n</div>\n</div>\n</div> Modal <div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"modal pdf-popup\">\n<div class=\"modal-dialog wide\">\n<div class=\"modal-body \">\n<div>\n<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"btn-close\" href=\"#\" id=\"close-pdf-modal\">\u00d7</a>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t          Can we contact you later to ask your opinion about the publication you just downloaded?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf yes, please leave your email below.

These needs can be generated by large, sudden and globally visible disasters as well as long-term hard to see events such as drought, a sudden upsurge of violence and forced movement of population; or long-term complex emergencies involving multiple elements of both conflict and natural disaster. Yet it doesn\u2019t need a major disaster or a major conflict to create basic humanitarian need; sometimes what might appear to an outsider as a relatively small event \u2013 the failure of a single crop, a mudslide \u2013 can tip a vulnerable family or community from poverty into a crisis that is literally a matter of life and death. The crisis will almost certainly make them more vulnerable in the future, forcing people to sell their assets and make choices that undermine their future wellbeing and the prospects for their children.</p>\n<p>Humanitarian response to this need is complex and varied and not without its confusion. It involves a plethora of actors, international and national, large and small, organisations with complex global mandates and organisations that serve a community or a neighbourhood. There are actions undertaken by militaries and governments and those by families and individuals. There is preparedness for events, immediate response to them, the provision of basic needs and the first elements of recovery. There is also a continual blurring of lines between humanitarian aid, investments in disaster preparedness, recovery programming, and long-term development spending.</p>\n<p>This myriad of interconnections is essentially what GHA Report 2010 attempts to track: the response to need, the provision of finance, the actors involved, the funding mechanisms used, and the countries and projects prioritised. A single dollar can actually be spent more than once with every choice made regarding the progress of that dollar through to a final recipient empowers one actor over another, and affects what is finally delivered and to whom.</p>\n<p>Effective humanitarian response has a long-term impact, reducing the human consequences of disasters and building resilience. It is one of the components that every society needs to protect the most vulnerable citizens, reduce risk and tackle poverty. At the same time, many people, especially those living in poverty, live their entire lives without the same basic elements that are delivered as part of humanitarian aid, whether that is clean water, adequate nutrition, the basic level of education or a means to earn a simple living. If there is one lesson that emerges from the Global Humanitarian Assistance programme\u2019s attempts to understand the way humanitarian financing works, it is this; if we want a coherent and effective response to humanitarian need, we need to stop classifying people\u2019s lives into artificial boxes that reflect our own management structures and use all of the tools that we have to reduce current and future vulnerability.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/gha-report-2010.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Download the report</a></p>\n</div>"}]
